## Lesson 14: Full-stack Developer

I recently read an article debating whether Superman or Spectre was more powerful. A poll was taken and an overwhelming amount of nerds voted in favor of Spectre.

It makes sense.

Spectre is granted limitless power by The Presence (DC Comics version of God) to accomplish any feat within his imagination...

#### ...It's kinda hard to beat that.

If that wasn't enough, he also has the ability to alter reality. He can warp time and space or shapeshift however he pleases. Another arrow in the ol' superpower quiver.

Oh yeah. And he has all the knowledge in the universe. And not just the universe we know. Spectre has all the knowledge from all the universes that may have been subjected to a time distortion.

Trust me. You ain't gettin' anything by that guy.

In one particular episode, Spectre even made The Joker feel remorse which was thought to have been impossible...

#### ...nuff said.

So it should come as no surprise that every leader in every tech company is looking for the Spectre engineer with all the expected superpowers...

...and without any further adieu, may I introduce you...

#### ...THE FULL STACK DEVELOPER!!!!!.

In the eyes of technology leaders, the full-stack developer has basically the same abilities as Spectre.

"What? We didn't deliver on time?" the CEO asks. "Can't you just, like, travel back in time or something?"

And like the comic superhero, not only is the full-stack developer all powerful...

#### ...the full-stack developer is completely make believe...

...it ain't easy.

"Mr. FSD!" we clamor. "Save us from crippling development dependencies and painfully awkward technology meetings where no decisions get made."

With his uniform of a hoodie and an unkempt hipster beard, the FSD swoops in encircled by a smoke cloud of pot.

"I have average intelligence in one specific thing and have a superficial knowledge of all things," he exclaims. "Here I am to save the day."

He eagerly gets to work.

Once you get to know the full-stack developer, you soon begin to realize that this person is less like a superhero and more like a villain in a Scooby Doo episode. After several sprints of disappointing releases, like Fred and Velma you start putting the puzzle pieces together.

"Let's see who is actually under this full-stack developer mask," you say as you rip off the fa√ßade.

"Oh, it's actually just a regular developer," everyone realizes the obvious.

"And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that meddling requirement to actually produce something," the developer laments.

On one particularly useless website, the full-stack developer is described as someone who is an expert in the front end and the backend of an application. They also tend to be well versed in both business logic and user experience. They have good communication skills and their experience helps them become leaders in the organization...

#### ...They can also breathe underwater and kick a 63 yard field goal.

At this point in my career, I have literally worked with hundreds and hundreds of engineers all over the world...

...I have yet to meet a developer that fits that description.

Yet I know they are our there, lurking in the deep waters of the engineering profession like a 20 pound largemouth bass.

"Look what we caught," Google says. "Check out the size of this one," Apple says. "Wow this is a biggun," Facebook says.

One thing is for sure. None of these mythical full-stack developers are being lured by the bait your company is throwing in the water...

...and yet...

...most likely your entire dev team strategy is based on having a pool of fat bigmouth full-stack developers...

#### ...and all you get is the overweight bigmouth part...

...it ain't easy.

This is why a lot of companies struggle with the most basic things like CSS. As a product manager you likely repeat over and over and over, "Isn't it 2021? Why are we struggling with things that were solved decades ago?"

All too often I see that the myth of the full-stack developer wreaks its havoc on application design. In our current delineation of roles and responsibilities there is a huge gap between what we know as the typical designer and what we know as the typical engineer.

And this is how things typically play out.

A graphic designer masquerading as a UX professional makes a static mockup in a program like Photoshop or Sketch or Figma...

...Aside: I really want to create a program for designers called Phetchma for designers which is just a basic text editor that upon opening says, "Learn CSS!"

Once the static mockups are complete, we all get to witness something really cute. The "professional" designer exports the CSS from one of these programs and gives it to the engineers as if that's what they are supposed to use.

"You can use this if you want?" the designer says, not realizing that the CSS produced by these designer programs is completely useless in the world of actual application development.

But none of this matters to the engineer. They are going to spend 99% of their time, you know, engineering, programming, and scrolling through coding memes on Instagram.

Once they get an application to function, the night before the project is due, they frantically start googling in hopes they might stumble upon a stackoverflow answer to their css ineptitude. They then start copying and pasting like a mofo.

Upon seeing the application design for the first time, everyone wonders why it looks like...

...well...

#### ...it looks like it was designed by a person who has the aesthetic sensibilities of a cinder block wall...

...a.k.a. an engineer.

The designers are naturally frustrated, "What the hell is this? It doesn't look and feel like the product I designed."

The engineers are frustrated, "What do you mean? It looks fine to me."

And product managers are stuck in the middle asking, "What wrong decisions did I make in life that led me down this road of endless misery?"

...it ain't easy.

Here's the lesson. You likely don't have a Spectre on your team. If you do, then count your luckily stars, say your hail marys, and perform whatever sacred ritual is required to get that person to stick around. Blackmail them if you have to. Because most likely they are already being lured in by better bait.

Since you probably don't have a Spectre, it means that someone in your company has to know, care, and own the relationship between designer and engineer. And as much as the company wants this person to be the full-stack developer they just hired out of a coding bootcamp, it's probably not them.

Someone must fill the gap between graphic design and functional engineering. I've seen where that person reports to the design team and they are responsible for the technical implication of a design. I've also seen where this person reports to the engineering team. Regardless, as a Product Manager whose job it is to make sure that real users get value from your product, you must force your company to have this conversation and force the ownership. If your company doesn't care and there isn't anyone that knows how to professionally style an application, then consider learning how to do it yourself or finding a job somewhere else. Life is too short to be haunted by the hell of constantly asking, "Why does this product suck so bad?"

And no, it wouldn't hurt for you to learn more about technical design yourself...

...that is...

#### ...if you are going to make a long career out of this...

...which...

...I don't blame you if you don't.

The point is that if you are a product manager, you can't just assume that everyone is a full-stack developer and that this design handoff problem will somehow just take care of itself. If you do, you'll get a product that you most definitely are embarrassed to put on your resume.

If you are a programmer, please admit the truth and tell your leaders you have zero desire to be implementing CSS and that you suck at it. Don't force product managers to accept your cinder-block design.

And if you are a graphic designer masquerading as a UX professional, then please go out and get my new program Phetchma...

#### ...and learn how design gets applied to a real software product.
