# Lesson 10: The Scorecard

Remember baseball cards...

...I do...

#### ...which puts me in an age bracket approaching the steep precipice of irrelevancy in software development.

But this much I will tell you. If you never had a baseball card collection, then you know nothing about stack ranking according to a weighted score...

...nothing!

Me and my friends would spend countless hours arranging our cards in priority order based upon key stats such as Home Runs, RBIs, ERA, etc. We created sophisticated ranking algorithms that would put the Facebook newsfeed to shame.

"Does the Earned Run Average and Base on Balls of Roger Clemens supersede the Slugging Percentage and Grounded Into Double Play of Barry Bonds?" I would frequently ask my friend Zach.

"Doesn't matter," he would say. "At least not when you compare it to their PED to red blood cell ratio."

We would then trade cards according to perceived value. Don Mattingly was in the upper tier of cards and could be traded for a seemingly equivalent card such as Cal Ripken Jr.  

And then there were the Ken Griffey Jr. cards — which held such an impossibly high value where the trades transcended the realm of sports.

"I'll trade you this Ken Griffey Jr. card for your Sega Genesis," I remember attempting a few times in my young baseball card trading career.

When I first became a Product Manager and was asked to stack rank a list of business priorities, I smugly thought to myself:

"That's all you want me to do? This is going to be a piece of cake. This task doesn't even involve an older brother trying to steal my cards."

I thought the system of ranking and scoring would translate to a list of my well-thought-out priorities that the business would gladly accept and the developers would gladly implement in sequential order.

At least, that's what all the blog articles had told me would happen...

...oh boy...

#### ...I not-so-gladly am here to say: it was all a lie...

...it ain't easy.

I have a 5-step hierarchy of effective methods for product discovery, persuasion, and priority.  

The top 4 are pretty decent methods:

- Prototypes  
- Observation  
- Interviews  
- Whiteboarding  

If done right, these methods all involve at least some form of market and user interaction.

And then...

There is a *huge* gap between these methods and scorecard ranking.

It's like you're asked to rate the coolness of your favorite Marvel Superheroes. You're given a list with Ironman, Thor, Wolverine, and Hulk. And then at the end of the list you see Captain Ultra.

"Who the hell is Captain Ultra?" you say to yourself.  

"Shouldn't there be another choice like Deadpool or Rocket Raccoon or something like that?"

Upon proper research, you learn that Captain Ultra was a former plumber mysteriously given powers without any real backstory — but for some reason, he developed a crippling fear of fire.

In one of the more obscure Marvel episodes, Captain Ultra once fainted because he saw a harmless little flame.

"What a lame superhero," you conclude.  

"I mean, dealing with fire and explosions is kind of a job requirement for superheroes, is it not?"

You then imagine what a movie about Captain Ultra would be like — the only equivalent comparison you can make is *Sleepless in Seattle*.

Suffice it to say:

Scorecard stack ranking is the Captain Ultra of prioritization and persuasion methods...

#### ...it's lame.

And of course, it shouldn't surprise any of us that it's the most popular method espoused in product management communities.

A quick Google search of "Product Management Scorecard" brings back no less than 17 million results in less than three-quarters of a second...

...Trust me when I say I've read them all — and each one gets lamer and lamer than the one that came before it.

The reason the scorecard is so popular is because it's a lazy way to not actually have to do real product management.  

It doesn't require any work.

"Sit at your desk, don't talk to anyone, and assign some arbitrary number value to this list of items," every article practically says.  

"Then present it to your executive team and bask in their unending praise of your skill and intelligence..."

#### ...ooh. How alluring?

Some methodologies, such as Scaled Agile, have taken this lifeless scoring method to the extreme with a cult-like ideology called WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)...

#### ...which is even less effective for prioritizing than **WWJD**.

Ok.

I don't write about anything I haven't personally experienced.

Here was my first experience with scorecard ranking:

I isolated myself for a few hours and assigned some meaningless values to my backlog items.  

I then showed it to our CEO (it was a small company) to get his feedback.

"Oh. If you would have just come and talked to me, I could have told you about our business and where we are going.  

Here's a list of some of our best customers you can talk with to get their feedback on your product. I'm excited to see what you learn."

"So... you don't care about this inconsequential list I put together, which I spent all of 30 minutes compiling?  

What you're trying to say is that your 15 years of market experience and thousands of customer and prospect conversations are actually more valuable than that?"  

I thought to myself as I choked back my tears.

Due to my lack of experience, it became painfully obvious that my scorecard "weighted" value actually didn't have any weight at all...

#### ...just bloated empty carbs.

I kind of have to blame this whole scorecard ranking thing on the proliferation of Agile methodology.  

They came up with a trendy way to estimate effort with a cool thing called the story point...

...and the product community got jealous and was like:

"Hey. We want a trendy scoring system too that can live side by side with your really rad story point estimates."

Not the kind to be outdone in coolness by a bunch of nerds, product people came up with the scorecard...

#### ...and that's how I'm guessing WSJF spawned from hell into existence.

Look...

If I have to convince you that:

Figuring out the effort of engineering development and figuring out the value of a product idea are not the same thing...

#### ...Product Management might not be the career for you.

Here's the lesson:

If you need to go through an exercise of scorecard ranking for your own information gathering and educational purposes, then go for it.

It can be personally valuable to understand what really matters to your business:

- Is the idea to increase revenue?  
- Reduce costs?  
- Or is it just a shiny penny sales needs to close a few more deals?

You need to know all these things.

So do it.

Your whole product team should go through scorecard-like exercises to:

- Understand the business impact  
- Articulate product objectives  
- Identify KPIs to measure success

I'm **not** saying **don't** do it...

...I'm just saying...

#### ...Don't expect anyone else to care about your stupid point system.

There are better ways to persuade your organization and prove you know what you're talking about.

In other words...

Don't be Captain Ultra who retreats at the tiniest smell of fire, tucking his scorecard tail between his legs, complaining with all the other losers at after-work gatherings about how the executives "just don't get it."

Step up and figure out how to be Iron Man...

...that's what your organization needs...

...and if you want to trade anything for a stack of Ken Griffey Jr. cards...

...let me know.
