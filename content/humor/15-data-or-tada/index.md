Lesson 15: Data or Tada

Who doesn't like a good magic trick?

"They're not tricks. They are illusions"...

...#nameThatShow.

Every magic trick is essentially the same. The magician presents the audience with some ordinary thing, like an adult woman lying in a box. Then something dramatic happens such as when the woman gets sawed in half. And then there is a resolution when the lady is put back together and climbs out of the box in one piece.

We all stare in jaw-dropping awe and the seeming miracle we just witnessed.

Now let me ask you this...

#### ...are you ready to perform some jaw-dropping miracles?

Make no mistake. Your organization leaders expect you to be a magician with product data. They have experienced the drama of trying to get data themselves, and now they anxiously await for you to resolve their concerns by performing a miracle. The data you materialize — seemingly out of thin air — will create game-changing business efficiency and insights the depth of Loch Ness...

#### ...and yes, finding the Loch Ness Monster might be a more achievable goal.

Yet you know that you are no magician, nor are you a mythical creature hunter. You are just a confused bystander who stumbled upon the stage but has no idea how the magic trick is supposed to work...

"I should be in the audience," you say to yourself as you stand there, the spotlight nearly blinding your eyes. "I guess I just wave my wand over this hat?" you think to yourself, feeling a little bit ridiculous. You then utter the words "Tada!"...

...no rabbit pops out.

You are left standing there like a fool...

#### ...the audience boos...

...it ain't easy.

It would be impossible to enumerate the number of articles and quotes that claim data is the key to being a successful product manager.

It matters.

So what you're looking for is the buzzword "data-driven". At least once a week you will hear someone tell you that you need to be making data-driven decisions.

I think there is even an official acronym for this concept which proves it has the complete support and forceful backing of the entire technological community.

DDDM stands for Data-Driven Decision Making.

Over the past decade or so, data fads have surfaced, sank, and re-surfaced like a Navy submarine. Until DDDM, it was all about data warehouses, and data lakes, and data mining and, of course, the Godzilla of all data concepts ...

#### ...Big Data.

Big Data infested the technology community like malware on a porn addicts laptop. Every company, regardless of the bigness of their data, launched a big data initiative.

But after every company across the globe collectively poured billions of dollars into big data initiatives, the end result was actually just a few bar and pie graphs.

"So what you're telling me is that our data actually isn't that big and that nobody cares and that big data isn't going to make my yacht payment?" most leaders finally admitted.

So now Big Data isn't quite the hype it used to be.

Now don't get me wrong, some companies really did have big data and they figured out how to use it for their own profit and world dominance. Those companies are now what are currently referred to as Big Tech. At one point in the past 5 years it was reported that 70% of internet traffic ultimately went through Google and Facebook companies.

Pretty much all information, including the manipulation of public opinion is now controlled by big data algorithms.

So unless you work in "Big Tech", your company probably sucks at gathering, organizing, and manipulating people in any meaningful way. Your data is likely scattered across a bunch of poorly structured databases and you're just trying to put it all together by begging people to run one-off queries so you can manually create your own excel spreadsheets.

"Can you please run that one query for me?" you sheepishly ask an engineer every Monday during the daily standup. The engineer rolls their eyes to make sure it is understood how inconvenient this request is. You are then given a lecture on how all these requests are not part of their sprint tasks and how these need to be considered as part of their available capacity. The rest of the dev team nods in agreement.

"Tada!" the engineer says after he takes 10 seconds out of his busy day to run the query. "You made me late for my ping pong match," he scolds.

That engineer vows to play an extra game of ping pong today to mentally recover from all the hardships you have put him through.

This is the world most of us operate in...

#### ...we are the fledgling group of small-tech small-data misfits...

So what do we do about the magic trick. Remember, you are definitely expected to make data driven decision even in the face of a complete data dearth. You will never be able to win in the arena of ideas if you can't back up your ideas and priorities with data.

I like to imagine product ideas as a WWE match.

"And in this corner we have a business executive with mighty industry experience, business muscle to make any decision he wants, and a mean corner office with a fridge full of Bubly Sparkling Water."

"And in this corner we have a product manager with the strength of a JIRA login, no data to support any of his ideas, and he works in a 3 x 3 cubicle on an IBM ThinkPad."

This fight would be like Hulk Hogan vs. Pee Wee Herman.

If you don't know who these 80s references are, then it would be like Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift. I mean, seriously, what is poor Taylor going to do?...

#### ...write a revenge song about how unfair life is.

"My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright"

Little did you know how much you have in common with Taylor Swift. Competing in the ring of product ideas without data is like bringing a knife to a gunfight...

#### ...or giving a weakass speech at the MTV Music Awards.

So here's the lesson. There's no excuse for not having data, and you have to do whatever it takes to get it. It is very unlikely that it will be presented to you in a tight little package with a pretty bow. It's going to take work. Nobody else is going to know how to get the data and you are going to have to perform a magic trick.

And let's try to resist the initial impulse of complaining about why the company doesn't embark on an expensive data initiative just so you can have a few bar and pie graphs.

Lastly, let's all calm down on the whole Big Data thing.

You don't need BIG DATA. You just need enough to show that you know what you are talking about, you know, so you can do the whole DDDM miracle.

Besides, Big Data doesn't even help you with some of the core product questions you need to answer. Here are the few problems you are trying to answer:

- Am I prioritizing the right value for our customers?
- Am I positioning the product effectively in the market?
- Am I meeting the companies financial and business goals?

While many PMs focus solely on usage data that is generated by the product, you need to be looking at many sources of valuable product data. Primarily this includes the hard work of talking to people and gaining insights from the real world, talking to people inside the company to understand the company's business model and strategic plan, and talking to people to stay on top of general tech and market trends.

In other words, don't just be a nerd who stares at an excel spreadsheet. You need to also gather qualitative data via conversation and real-world user feedback.

So go get the product data that will let you DDDM. Figure out the magic trick. Go hunt for the Loch Ness monster. Do these hard things and build your product ideas on a solid foundation of data and you will have much greater chance for success with your products.

"Tada!" you'll exclaim.

And who can argue with the miracles they can't explain?
