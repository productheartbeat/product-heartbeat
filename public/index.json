I know. And it\u0026rsquo;s only the first paragraph. Keep reading\u0026hellip; # No, it\u0026rsquo;s not a \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo;. I put the word \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; in sarcastic double-quotes to flagrantly laugh in the face of institutionalized book publishing. I mean, nothing has stopped product managers from releasing whatever they want, whenever they want, regardless of value or qualitty.\n\u0026hellip;Ha! Look, the word quality has a typo, which means I had to purposefully ignore the red-squiggly-spell-corrector-underline-thingy\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s how edgy this is. # Suffice it to say that no stuffy bean counter in a corporate office is going to hamper the innovative spirit of product management. If we have a motto, it\u0026rsquo;s that we move fast, break things, and occasionally sell people\u0026rsquo;s data for politics and profit\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;so sue us. (That\u0026rsquo;s just a figure of speech. Please don\u0026rsquo;t sue us.) # If I\u0026rsquo;m being honest, I\u0026rsquo;m actually appalled at the few printed books out there on Product Management. Shame on the author\u0026rsquo;s who inexcusably released a product without any plan to iterate beyond the MVP\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s pre-meditated non-tech debt, and I, for one, refuse to go there. # So you won\u0026rsquo;t find this \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; on Amazon, or at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, or in the library (are those still a thing?). That is sooooo un-disruptive. (Unless of course someone offered me a book deal. Then I would obviously sell out for money.)\nInstead, this documentation pushes the boundaries of interaction, iteration, and innovation. I mean, seriously, if we are going to invest in writing about product management, let\u0026rsquo;s at least try to not do that one thing that we all know we are not supposed to do\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;gasp think inside the box. # Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s push the envelope, break down silos, give 110%, and do all the other cliché things that we can think of.\nYou might ask, \u0026ldquo;Why is lesson 1 ‘It Ain\u0026rsquo;t Easy\u0026rsquo;? It seems like all Product Managers do is get software engineers to do all the work and then take all the credit.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, while this is true, I\u0026rsquo;m tellin\u0026rsquo; ya, it actually is hard work.\nFirst off, why should engineers do anything we say? They\u0026rsquo;re the smart ones with real skills. We\u0026rsquo;re just nuisances with dumb backlogs full of legacy code bugs? The currently employed engineers didn\u0026rsquo;t write that code. Is it really their job to fix it? While the answer is obviously yes, getting engineers to understand this is like getting Donald Trump to consider socialism\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # It\u0026rsquo;s also hard work because product management is a profession for which there is no formal job description, education, or accreditation. We\u0026rsquo;re perpetually dealing in the unknown of things that don\u0026rsquo;t yet exist, so we just make it up as we go. And although there certainly should be, there\u0026rsquo;s no state board that ensures we know the ins and outs of GDPR requirements. I\u0026rsquo;ve had several product management jobs now and none of them have been even remotely similar to each other. And even though we all claim to be Agile, which, by the way, means absolutely nothing, you\u0026rsquo;ll be harassed by a bunch of opinionated people who think it does\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # And lastly, discovering and building a product that the market will naturally pay for with time or money is one of the toughest challenges in the world. I mean, millennials don\u0026rsquo;t pay for anything except coffee, air pods, and student loans. The difficulty of getting someone to pay for something goes right up there with nuclear physics, brain surgery, and remembering a sufficiently strong password\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;It@int3@$y. # So in the fearless spirit of doing things that ain\u0026rsquo;t easy or for which I have no particular expertise, I\u0026rsquo;ll be tackling a variety of topics which will either take your product management career to the next level or make you reconsider your career choice and get into something more reliable.\nEither way, at the end I strongly believe we will all come to the same conclusion\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;damn it, why didn\u0026rsquo;t I learn how to write code? # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/it-aint-easy/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 1: It Ain't Easy","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/unlimited-pto/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Unlimited pto","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 2: CEO of Your Product # Someone once said that a Product Manager should act like the CEO of their product. Since then there has been an internal conflict within the Product community that could rival the civil war\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;except this war has zero civility whatsoever. # Just look at the titles of these articles:\nYou are NOT the CEO of anything 6 ways the Product Manager is the CEO To People calling Product Managers Mini-CEO, Please Stop Product Managers are Mini-CEOs And for at least one individual, this mostly sums it up: \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t say it out loud. But in reality, I am the CEO of the Product\u0026rdquo;. One score and a 7 months after that first publication it is still a hot debate. Just know that as a Product Manager, you will be forced to pick a side, usually instigated by some form of demeaning verbal abuse:\n\u0026ldquo;Are you the CEO of your f***ing product or not?!\u0026rdquo; An angry executive from any of many departments will surely yell at you when you don\u0026rsquo;t deliver their list of 99 features within a sprint iteration.\nWhile there will always be people who want to make Product Management more or less important than it is, what side you choose has absolutely no impact on your day-to-day. Because at the end of the day-to-days, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be relegated to what the biz calls \u0026ldquo;the wringable neck.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Ahhh. The wringable neck. # Now that\u0026rsquo;s what I call a motivational poster. If being a wringable neck doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound very appealing, just think of the poor job recruiter who has to sell a potential PM candidate on the job. \u0026ldquo;How would you like to be the one everyone blames for things you have no control over? But don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you get to call yourself a mini-CEO.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ooh. How alluring. Where do I sign?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But c\u0026rsquo;mon,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re saying. \u0026ldquo;Is the neck wringing really that bad?\u0026rdquo; Well, when it comes to being the wringable neck, I\u0026rsquo;ve only had this happen 581 times in my career, which is on the low side compared to most. Most statistics indicate that once a product manager gets past their rookie year, they either quit out of self-respect or they just go full on masochist\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Please! Wring my neck one more time. You know how I like it.\u0026rdquo; # The odd thing is that the product community talks about being the CEO as well as the wringable neck all in one elongated breath.\nContradiction, much?\nBecause unless you are Brad Pitt in a nerdy tech-startup version of the Fight Club (called Byte Club), it would be weird to have the authority to wring necks and simultaneously choose to wring your own. This has psychological implications beyond the scope of this book. But it does give a small glimpse into why all product managers seem to be mentally confused, mentally ill, and mentally mental.\nSeriously, if you were applying for a job and found a job description with a phrase like \u0026ldquo;single wringable neck\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;one throat to choke\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;d think you were applying to become an MMA fighter.\n\u0026ldquo;And in this corner we have a nerd who made an unfortunate decision to not learn how to write code: THE PRODUCT MANAGER!!!\u0026rdquo;\nOnly in this fight, no one is cheering for you. Everyone just wants you to get your ass kicked\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure when Product Managers became the subject of so much figurative violence. From my extensive research on the first page of Google search results, there are articles going all the way back to 2009. That\u0026rsquo;s more than a decade of cruel and unusual punishment, specifically focused on the neck area. So if sexually abused women get to have their \u0026ldquo;#meToo\u0026rdquo; movement, Product Managers are equally deserving of the next iteration of their own outcry against corporate abuse\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;#meTwoPointZero\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;yeah, that joke went too far\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;#pushingBoundaries. # If you\u0026rsquo;re really lucky, as the CEO of your Product, you might get involved in what is known as a good old-fashioned choke-off. This is when 2 or more executives battle to see who can wring your neck the hardest, each with the hopes that said neck-wringing will advance their own politically motivated agenda.\n\u0026ldquo;Without my 99 features, we won\u0026rsquo;t close any deals, and I\u0026rsquo;ll never become the CEO!\u0026rdquo; says the head of sales.\n\u0026ldquo;Without my 99 features, we will lose all our customers, and I\u0026rsquo;ll never become the CEO!\u0026rdquo; says the head of support\n\u0026ldquo;Wait, these people are gunning for my job.\u0026rdquo; says the CEO.\nThe product manager is really there to make sure the executives don\u0026rsquo;t have to do the unthinkable and work together as a cohesive leadership team\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;that would be too hard\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s easier just to blame the single wringable neck and mask any leadership incompetency. # So what\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nThe lesson here is that your neck is going to have some scars and bruises, whether you like it (masochist) or not. Product Management is not for the faint of heart or the weak of esophagus. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to succeed as a Product Manager, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to do this one thing: courageously take an idea you are passionate about and stick your neck out for it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;oh yeah\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s gonna get choked\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;and you\u0026rsquo;re gonna start to like it.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/ceo-of-your-product/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 2: Be The CEO Of Your Product","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/how-did-you-become-a-pm/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"How did you become a pm","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 3: Priorities # Isn\u0026rsquo;t it ironic that the chapter on priorities isn\u0026rsquo;t ordered at the top of the chapter list? Especially since I set this chapter to a ranking of \u0026ldquo;critical\u0026rdquo;.\nBut obviously all the other chapters are critical too. Damn. How am I supposed to decide which comes first?\nWell let\u0026rsquo;s put it this way. If making decisions that impact the livelihood of everyone in the organization based on little or no information makes you queasy, expect to be puking a lot. I visit the bathroom to yak at least twice daily.\n\u0026ldquo;Yuk. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember eating that. Welp. Back to work.\u0026rdquo;\nAs gross as it sounds, this is your job: to prioritize chaos and vomit things into existence\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # Prioritization is to Product Management what dung is to the Dung Beetle. It\u0026rsquo;s a shitty part of who we are.\nWe know this because the canonical record contained within the holy Agile institution known as \u0026ldquo;Mountain Goat Software\u0026rdquo; states, and I quote, \u0026ldquo;A Product Manager\u0026rsquo;s responsibility is to blah blah blah blah blah.\u0026rdquo; And then there\u0026rsquo;s some rambling on about the Product Manager\u0026rsquo;s duty to decide the future of the business in its entirety and if things don\u0026rsquo;t work out it\u0026rsquo;s his or her fault\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;on a disappointing side note, there is virtually no information about Mountain Goats at Mountain Goat Software\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;which would make the site infinitely more valuable.\nClearly no one would willingly volunteer for the blah blah blah part, which explains why most Product Managers have no idea how they got there or who they even are.\n\u0026ldquo;An Italian Fisherman found my body at sea with 2 bullets in my back. I had a mysterious key to a lockbox and inside was an application for a job in Product Management.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds an awful lot like the opening scene to Bourne Identity,\u0026rdquo; says every recruiter when I tell them my story.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be real. No one wants this life. Well. Almost no one.\nIf you are a man or woman with the sole desire of weaseling your way into power, then maybe this prioritizing responsibility sounds enticing. Or hell, if you are a weasel with the sole purpose of becoming a man or woman, anything is possible in today\u0026rsquo;s society\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Elizabeth Holmes is probably working on a rodent-to-human prototype as we speak\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;I should invest.\n#humanWeasel\nBut if you are like most, neither a megalomaniac or a weasel or any combination of the two, then you likely tremble in the face of this Goliath task to prioritize a tech company\u0026rsquo;s initiatives. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the weightiest jobs known to humankind\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;just below Navy Seal and just above the guy delivering your wife\u0026rsquo;s Amazon Prime order. # \u0026ldquo;All we want you to do is take all the feedback from every voice in the market and whittle it down to 3 validated items. Engineers will fail to deliver 2 of them, and everyone\u0026rsquo;s livelihood is riding on what\u0026rsquo;s left. Good luck.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uh. Can I get my orientation packet first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # The work of prioritizing is done in what is commonly known as the backlog. I think they first called it a backlog because it\u0026rsquo;s quite literally as burdensome as a log on your back.\n\u0026ldquo;Dude, why are you coming to work with that log on your back?\u0026rdquo; some co-worker said. \u0026ldquo;Just let it go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my job to convey the backlog,\u0026rdquo; the PM said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t just let it go!\u0026rdquo;\nYou have to admit that the backlog is a much funnier word when pictured as a literal log\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;This is the kind of stuff that gets me through the day. # But not everyone treats the backlog so flippantly. Although it\u0026rsquo;s really just a fancy word for a list, Agile Masters, Scrum Coaches, and Mountain Goats try to pretend it\u0026rsquo;s much more than that, going as far as calling it an artifact, as if it were excavated from a Mayan ruin.\n\u0026ldquo;Behold this perplexing artifact which appears to be a simple list of things,\u0026rdquo; some archaeologist says as he dusts off a tablet of ancient engravings. \u0026ldquo;I wonder what it was used for? Perhaps we shall call it THE BACKLOG!\u0026rdquo;\nTo be fair I\u0026rsquo;m sure the Mayans had a backlog of sorts, but you certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be on the implementation team for one of their stories:\nAs the god of harvest, I need a human sacrifice, so the lowly villagers can grow crops.\n\u0026ldquo;Who wants this story with a subtask of ‘sacrifice yourself\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; said the Mayan Scrum Master. \u0026ldquo;Any takers?\u0026rdquo;\nUnfortunately as the experts get more entrenched, the product backlog gets more complicated. What started as a simple to-do list has become a twisted mind maze, the kind where you\u0026rsquo;re being chased through the snow by an ax-wielding Jack Nicholson. The ax in this reference is obviously the rigor of sprint ceremonies.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Heeeeeere\u0026rsquo;s Sprint Planning!\u0026rdquo; # Yep. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there. Any of us who have been doing this long enough has had that horrifying feeling on a Monday morning:\n\u0026ldquo;Oh no. Sprint Planning is today. I had 2 weeks to prepare for this, and I mistakenly spent the entire time visiting with customers and discovering market needs. We all know there\u0026rsquo;s no time for that!\u0026rdquo;\nYou then spend 30 minutes cramming some made up garbage into the backlog so engineers can stay busy for a scrum interval.\n\u0026ldquo;Phew. That bought me a couple weeks.\u0026rdquo;\nIn many organizations who call themselves Agile, the product backlog has become an entire institutionalized system of coldly calculated WSJF scores, absent of any product whatsoever\u0026hellip;.\n\u0026hellip;not to mention passion, life, or joy.\nSo to add a little fun (if your sprint rules allow for laughter) copy and paste the following phrase into a text-to-speech reader. https://ttsreader.com/.\n\u0026ldquo;I am the backlog. I live in a world called Jira. If you implement my items in sequential order then I will output something that gets your customers turnt. At least, I think that\u0026rsquo;s the word all the cool kids are saying these days.\u0026rdquo;\nOne thing we can all agree on is that the backlog has an enchanting allure to it. It possesses a bewitching, hypnotic effect.\nWhenever a customer or key stakeholder brings up an item that has a snowball\u0026rsquo;s chance in hell of getting developed, we can utter the magical phrase, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll put it in the backlog\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd just like that\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;instant appeasement. # There\u0026rsquo;s no need to mention that the item is so deep in Jira\u0026rsquo;s bowels that you\u0026rsquo;d have to descend into its 9 circles of hell to find it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no need to mention that the item is so irrelevant that it now exists next to a list of people you want to date in the office.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no need to mention that the primary purpose of a backlog is to fill it with useless items you are never going to get to\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;#soTrue.\nAnd so now that you know your backlog is likely full of senseless garbage that not even Marty Mcfly\u0026rsquo;s Delorean could use as fuel, what are Product Managers to do with it?\nHmmm. Would it be shocking to say you let it go? Take the log off your back? After all, it\u0026rsquo;s just a list. Stop trying to turn it into an artifact. Instead, try doing your job: define outcomes and work with people to achieve them.\nLooking back on every successful product I\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky enough to be involved with, I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t remember the process, or tools, or backlog organization. What I do remember are the people that learned what the market needed and beat all odds to create something amazing.\nI promise there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as the perfect sequence of stories, conjured up in that isolated vacuum you call your mind, that is going to output anything that could resemble the word \u0026ldquo;innovation\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a team effort, and the people on the team have to care about the product they are building.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nThe lesson is that done right, prioritizing the backlog, as it is so called, is just a common sense thing that naturally happens. It starts with a Product and outcomes and then you go from there. With this kind of dumbed down common sense logic, the most important thing is that \u0026ldquo;the product should create the backlog, not the other way around\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;now there\u0026rsquo;s a quotable phrase you can tweet to your social empire. # What I\u0026rsquo;m really hoping by writing this article is that someday, after you\u0026rsquo;ve created some really great and meaningful products that resonate with real people, you\u0026rsquo;ll dust off your old process-driven backlogs and exclaim like the Mayan archeologist did, \u0026ldquo;Behold this perplexing artifact.

But it never does. You\u0026rsquo;ll spend roughly 100% of your time coming up with strategies related to whatever buzzword an executive recently read about on Forbes.com. Exactly 0% of the products you deliver will have anything to do with a trending buzzword.\n\u0026ldquo;So what do you have for us this quarter?\u0026rdquo; the marketing department will ask. \u0026ldquo;We need something exciting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we just completed epic 4 of 15 regarding General Data Protection Regulations,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ve been saying for years.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay.

You are failing and should be ashamed to bear the Product Manager job title.

Our product team was inconsolable.\n\u0026ldquo;How can we compete with that?\u0026rdquo; We debated in hundreds of meetings. \u0026ldquo;Not only do they have AI, it\u0026rsquo;s military grade.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the time we were struggling just to get a CSS media query to work, a formidable challenge indeed, but nothing like infusing our software with the power and might of the U.S. Department of Defense.\nAnd then I met the weasel who created the software at an industry trade show. I stopped by his booth and asked him about his military grade intelligence. The conversation went something like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Hey Weasel. What\u0026rsquo;s up with your Military Grade Artificial Intelligence?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh that. Haha. I used to be an IT Specialist in the US Army and now my boss makes jokes about our military grade software and it just kinda stuck.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that was that.\nSee what you\u0026rsquo;re up against.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # Just to stay on a level playing field, good product managers will claim their products ooze with Artificial Intelligence. If you are struggling to get engineers to deliver anything worthwhile, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. Take one of your existing products and make an announcement that it now has artificial intelligence. When the inevitable happens and a naïve engineer confronts you by saying something dumb like, \u0026ldquo;No it doesn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo;, tell them to get back to work on legacy code bugs.\nWith all your artificial marketing about artificial intelligence, you will also need to experiment with related tech jargon such as machine learning, deep learning, and deep machining\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which is just porn for A.I. robots. # Whatever you do, don\u0026rsquo;t get stuck in the realities of what your product can and can\u0026rsquo;t do. Just do your job, which is to have an artificially intelligent product, whether you have one or not.\nFollow this guidance and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to impress the C-suite with your innovations and wow the market with your artificial products. After all, We are Product Managers.\n\u0026ldquo;Join us or die!\u0026rdquo;\nOkay, Gemini. You\u0026rsquo;re starting to scare me.\nAnything But Reality (ABR) # Reality sucks, which is why we are constantly trying to augment it, virtualize it, torture it, and hopefully dispose of it altogether\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;or at least make people look ridiculous in the process. # Have you ever seen someone use VR, flailing their arms around oblivious to their surroundings? Have you ever seen someone in the real world trying to catch a Pokémon? In both scenarios you are forced to think, \u0026ldquo;This is completely inappropriate at Grandma\u0026rsquo;s funeral.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd yet here we are, strapping headsets to our face and desperately trying to ignore whatever the real world has to offer.\nI remember when I was a kid, my parents would scold me for sitting to close to the TV. I was genuinely afraid that if I sat closer than 15 feet, the atomic TV light beams would melt my eyes and I would end up wandering the earth as a blind vagabond, my last memory being an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\nNow, in today\u0026rsquo;s world, TVs and eyes are quite literally one and the same.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me what you see,\u0026rdquo; the eye doctor will say.\n\u0026ldquo;I see the latest Avenger movie taking place on your forehead.\u0026rdquo;\nYou will be diagnosed with 20 / 8k vision, the only cure being another headset you strap to your face.\nIn all seriousness, it seems like product managers should be taking my parents advice and issuing a strong scolding, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put the TV in your eyes.\u0026rdquo;\nBut since people in this society have already sold their soul to the virtual devil, as a Product Manager, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to get those lost souls to pay you a portion of that blood money.\nTo do this you need to have empathy for your users. And to gain empathy you may have to find out what it\u0026rsquo;s like to stop experiencing reality. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with what this might look like, here\u0026rsquo;s a 10 step program:\nWake up in the afternoon. Stop showering Only eat cold cereal. Close the shades. Stay inside. Get fired from your job Move in with your parents Make memes and post them on social media. Yell at mom to do your laundry Don\u0026rsquo;t pick up your mountain dew cans off the floor.\nThis list is a long-winded way of saying, \u0026ldquo;Just watch porn all day.\u0026rdquo; Honestly, the applications of VR are only limited to things you do in private, and ain\u0026rsquo;t nobody using VR to pray\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;God help us. # Blockchain # You need blockchain to stay relevant. When artificial intelligence takes over and we all are subjected to live in a virtual prison, we won\u0026rsquo;t be leveling up our avatars with cash.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s a Benji?\u0026rdquo; asks a new generation.\nWhen it comes to blockchain, the ultimate goal is to invent a cryptocurrency that the world depends on to transact business. Because he who rules the blocks rules the world. Looking back it now makes sense that when I was in nursery school I would hoard the building blocks and not let any other kids play with them. Little did I know I was preparing to be a productive Product Manager\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;either that or I was just being a little jerk baby. # The reality is that none of us know any more about blockchain today than I did as a preschooler, but we must pretend like we do. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start with blockchain, which we all know you don\u0026rsquo;t, here\u0026rsquo;s a few phrases you can use to sound smart.\n\u0026ldquo;Have we considered a blockchain architecture to solve this problem?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I need to attend the upcoming blockchain conference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I bet Donald Trump will use blockchain to win the next election.\u0026rdquo;\nIf understanding blockchain wasn\u0026rsquo;t already hard enough, now imagine trying to describe your job to relatives.\n\u0026ldquo;So what is it that you do again?\u0026rdquo; your diesel mechanic uncle asks at a family reunion.\n\u0026ldquo;I develop cryptocurrency solutions using blockchain,\u0026rdquo; you might be tempted to respond, thinking you sound impressive.\n\u0026ldquo;I always knew you would be a nerd,\u0026rdquo; will be the guaranteed response.\nWell, if anyone is going to call you a nerd, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be me\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;nerd. # The point is, don\u0026rsquo;t try to go all nerdy on your friend and family. Instead, explain blockchain in easy words they can understand. With my vast experience I\u0026rsquo;ve boiled it down to a simple explanation anyone can comprehend.\nHere we go.\nThere are these things called blocks. These blocks are linked together by other things called chains. And\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Oh $#!+\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;not even I can fake this one. # The good news for Product Managers is that you\u0026rsquo;ll never actually need to know anything about blockchain\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;just tell your uncle he\u0026rsquo;s a dumb redneck who doesn\u0026rsquo;t deserve your aunt\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;you can tell your boss the same thing\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;give or take the aunt part.\nJust remember that regardless of how much you know about blockchain, your redneck boss will ask you to come up with intricate and well-formulated strategies for how to use blockchain in use cases that make no sense\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;good luck.\nConclusion # So what\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nThe lesson is that I could ramble on about other buzzwords like IoT, microservices, big data, chatbots, natural language processing, actionable analytics, voice recognition, edge computing, smart factories, 5g, haptics\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;seriously, I could go on and on.\nServerless architecture, dark data, smart contracts, automation, stealth technology, OCR, neural network, decentralization, progressive web apps, data science, algorithm\u0026hellip;\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/buzzwords/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 4: Buzzwords","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/phones-on-silence/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Phones on silence","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 5: Working With Engineers # One day my daughter was watching one of her annoying kid shows. This time it was Octonauts. This ridiculous cartoon was about a greedy whale louse that lived inside a benevolent sea sponge. This particular episode poorly attempted to teach kids about the principle of commensalism\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;the other C word kids learn right after \u0026ldquo;cookie\u0026rdquo; # Well, if you had more than a preschooler\u0026rsquo;s education, you\u0026rsquo;d know that commensalism is a relationship where one organism (in this case the selfish louse) benefits greatly while offering nothing in return. Upon watching this episode I exclaimed out loud, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a f***ing whale louse.\u0026rdquo;\nI then had to tell my daughter to do as I say, not as I do\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which in this case meant not doing as I say. # \u0026hellip;parenting ain\u0026rsquo;t easy either. # If we stretch this commensalism analogy like taffy and apply it to our work lives, then engineers are sea sponges in the open ocean of software development, lending their gift of social anxiety for the common benefit of everyone else.\nYou might ask yourself, why would anyone sign up for that? One thing is for sure, I\u0026rsquo;ve met a lot of engineers and I can tell you it\u0026rsquo;s not out of the goodness of their sea sponge heart.\n\u0026ldquo;I get paid a lot to do very little,\u0026rdquo; most engineers will readily admit.\nThe reality is that like most of us, engineers didn\u0026rsquo;t know what they were getting into when they chose their career path. Most engineers got into the profession because they had visions of writing cool code that does cool things.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to build something cool,\u0026rdquo; they told themselves while looking in the mirror at a very uncool reflection.\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve seen the rise of social networks, smartphones, space exploration and swipe right booty calls. And just like booty, this is their opportunity to reach out and grab it, right?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;wrong. # Little did they know when they started their first job that most of the tech world is older than expected, is riddled with unmanageable logic, is full of nasty baggage, and is burdened with debt\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;just like their last booty call\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;the booty jokes may never end. # They are more likely to end up working on the defects of a value-added tax calculation than sending a man to Mars\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;although at least a miscalculation in a tax code won\u0026rsquo;t send a man hurling into the unknown of outer-space\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;probably should have QAd that stored procedure called \u0026ldquo;marsLandingEquation\u0026rdquo;. # Let\u0026rsquo;s face it. If the company has been around long enough to have customers, make money, and afford a fridge full of Redbulls, then its technology is already obsolete. And In order to get to a point of profitability, the company had to make hundreds of compromises in code quality just to meet deadlines and bring in cash.\n\u0026ldquo;Just get this out the door quickly and then we\u0026rsquo;ll come back and fix it later,\u0026rdquo; is a phrase repeated millions of times every day across the software industry\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;No one ever comes back to it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;ever\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;never. # Typically the engineer who wrote the codebase no longer works there and no one understands what the hell the code is supposed to do. Everyone admits it\u0026rsquo;s a miracle the program works at all. Modern code management software now tracks who changes files, so every currently employed engineer is afraid to touch the code in fear of having their name associated to such a mess. As an engineer, whoever last touched a file is the now doomed to own that code forever as the subject matter expert (SME).\nMuch of an engineer\u0026rsquo;s career is spent trying to avoid becoming that person.\nBecause no one cares enough to actually figure it out and document it, sprint after sprint engineers just pile new code on top of bad while constantly complaining about needing to throw everything away and start over from scratch. This creates a perpetual environment of what is called spaghetti code\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;with big ol\u0026rsquo; buggy meatballs. # Yep. 10% of an engineers job is coding. The Other 90% is debugging.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nSo just like that, every idealistic dream and good coding principle gets abandoned within the first few hours of an engineers\u0026rsquo; career. That once hopeful nube is now jaded and cynical, beat down by the heavy hammer of software development. The average developer just comes to work in order to write some shitty code and collect a pay check\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;all with the goal of playing as much ping pong as possible. # Unfortunately for you and your ego, the law of commensalism tells us that you desperately need engineering resources to give a damn if you\u0026rsquo;re going to survive.\nA little side note on the word \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo;. I once was told that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use the word \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo; to describe engineers. I was told this was dehumanizing and essentially the equivalent of torturing people at Guantanamo Bay. Of course, this insightful comment came from someone in HR\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I mean, when Human Resources says we can\u0026rsquo;t call people resources, we are dealing with a level of hypocrisy and corruption not yet known to mankind. # Now back to working with engineers\u0026hellip;\nWhen it comes to working with engineers, what this all means is that you have to fake it. If you want to be a decent product manager, if you want to create innovative products, if you want to make sure developers don\u0026rsquo;t badmouth you around the coffee maker, you should pretend like you care about their intrinsic motivations and inspirations.\nWhere usually you would say something like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Sit in your chair and complete this list of requirements I created without your input. You can have a 5 minute potty break if you have an acceptable burndown.\u0026rdquo;\nInstead try something like this:\n\u0026ldquo;Help me solve this problem. Afterwards we\u0026rsquo;ll grab some beers and play Rocket League.\u0026rdquo;\nThat wasn\u0026rsquo;t so hard now, was it?\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nThe point of this lesson is that working with engineers isn\u0026rsquo;t actually that hard. You just have to realize that their hopes and dreams have been dashed and so you should treat them as real human beings instead of factory robots.\nDo this and the law if commensalism will be working in your favor\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you f***ing self-absorbed whale louse. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/working-with-engineers/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 5: Working With Engineers","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/ai-feature/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Ai feature","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 6: Steve Jobs # Despite being dead for some time now, Steve Jobs is very well alive in the Product community. Whether you are an Apple fan or not, you will rarely get through a day without hearing a reference to a Product he built or an obscure quote he uttered. Damn. I\u0026rsquo;m even dedicating an entire chapter to him. He is to Product Management what Jesus is to Christianity\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;A turtle-necked god. # Steve Jobs acted out loud in ways people only whisper about in hushed tones. And in this way he did what any aspiring Product Manager strives to do\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;no, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about accepting a $1.00 annual salary\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Im talking about ignoring the damn customer. # \u0026ldquo;A lot of times people don\u0026rsquo;t know what they want until you show it to them,\u0026rdquo; Steve was famously quoted.\nOf course comments like these spark debates that could resemble the Final Battle of Winterfell. But the point isn\u0026rsquo;t who is right or wrong regarding listening to the customer. The point is about achieving the Product Managers dream\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and the dream is to have no customers so you finally have time to build a product customers want. # Is there irony in that dream?\nSure.\nBut if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing we Product Managers love to do, it\u0026rsquo;s complain about the stupidity of our customers. In fact, the only thing getting in the way of becoming a legendary Product virtuoso is our pain-in-the-ass customer with their stupid support requests and lame contractual obligations and dumb paid invoices. Our backlogs are so full of maintaining the current business that there isn\u0026rsquo;t time to build a utopian future of pure product nirvana.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s so amazing about Steve Jobs. He didn\u0026rsquo;t just dream it. He actually did it. Fearlessly. He built products with complete disregard of the existing customer. While Microsoft was trying to be backwards compatible all the way to MS-DOS, Steve Jobs was like, \u0026ldquo;F*** you! Here\u0026rsquo;s a 30-pin connector. Go buy a bunch of new expensive cables, suckers!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;What a visionary! # The typical product manager–without the MacBalls of Steve Jobs–will cower when faced with a decision that might make a customer unhappy. We\u0026rsquo;ve all capitulated and scrapped a bold release at the last minute because it was deemed to be \u0026ldquo;too risky.\u0026rdquo;\nDo you think Steve Jobs gave a Magic Mouse\u0026rsquo;s ass about risk?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just say I doubt he ever attended a meeting called \u0026ldquo;iTunes Risk Mitigation.\u0026rdquo;\nBut instead, product managers are bombarded with hundreds of reasons not to do anything other than upgrade to the latest version of PHP. This also means we\u0026rsquo;ve capitulated on our dreams and we are now filling our backlogs full of uninspiring nonsense that \u0026ldquo;keeps the lights on.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;A zero-risk lightswitch flipper\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s the mundane and redundant reality of our unsexy role as Product Manager\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;we ain\u0026rsquo;t no Steve Jobs.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nWhen it comes to executives, however, they will expect you to keep the lights on as well as create apple-esque products each quarter. Trust me, every single member of your executive team is an Apple devotee. They parade around the office with their $3000 Apple Care protected Macbooks while forcing everyone else to use IBM Thinkpads well beyond the expired warranty. If the touchpad ceases to function, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to learn how to use that bizarre pointing stick in the middle of the keyboard\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;haha, the pointing stick. Now there\u0026rsquo;s a feature a stupid customer requested, the Product team knew it was a bad idea, but they were forced to implement anyway\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;probably in the name of keeping the lights on.\nOne time I committed myself the entire day to learning the pointing stick.\n\u0026ldquo;This pointing stick must have have product benefits way better than the trackpad,\u0026rdquo; I convinced myself. \u0026ldquo;Otherwise why would a product manager continue to include it\u0026rdquo;.\nI spent the rest of the day just trying to double click on an excel file on my desktop. I then begged my boss for a Macbook. He denied my request because MacBooks were only for executives.\nExecutives will all expense for each other Apple watches at the office Christmas party. These watches will flamboyantly adorn the same arms that pull the ripcord of their Golden parachutes, constantly checking an onslaught of wrist messages during key stakeholder meetings.\nThey will all have the latest version of the iPhone and somehow they never had to stand in line to get it. They had an assistant do that\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;maybe even a Product Manager\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;who, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, to them is just a glorified assistant. # \u0026ldquo;I need you to have empathy for what it feels like to create a product in demand. Go stand in line and buy me the latest iPhone,\u0026rdquo; they might say\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I know, that joke would have been funnier back when people actually stood in line for iPhones. We all know Steve is disappointingly observing from the afterlife as angels stand in line for the new release of his latest iHarp\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;or let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, probably the iPitchfork.\nRegardless of your company\u0026rsquo;s size or capital investment, every executive wants their company to be like Apple and you, the Product Manager, are their ticket to success\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;A trillion dollars or bust\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;Oh yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna bust. # It\u0026rsquo;s why every survey on Product Management indicates that executives are constantly disappointed by the job their Product Managers are doing.\n\u0026ldquo;How would you rate the job your Product Manager is doing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dissatisfied.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She isn\u0026rsquo;t Steve Jobs.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be clear. You were hired under some delusional fantasy that you could transform their sloth of a business into an innovation machine. And when you fail to do so, it will be your fault\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;even if you do indeed keep the lights on. # Just know that as a Product Manager you will be unrealistically expected to follow in the footsteps of Steve Jobs and innovate for the future while making damn sure you don\u0026rsquo;t lose any customers.\nImpossible\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;absolutely\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Welcome to Product Management\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;It ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # But as important as ignoring the customer is, it\u0026rsquo;s not the most important thing Steve Jobs gave to Product Management. The most important thing is that he finally gave us permission to be the dicks we always knew we were but were too socially conscious to exhibit.\nFor a bunch of nerds who are hopelessly insecure about our inability to code, we can leverage that insecurity to berate people in Steve Jobs fashion\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;afterall, beratement is the sincerest form of flattery. # It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you burn through all your office relationships. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if your customers leave because, according to you, they are stupid. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if your daughter thinks you\u0026rsquo;re an idiot. You are on a mission to innovate, and sometimes you gotta crack some Newtons to make an iPad\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Newton is also the name of an associate engineer on your team.\nLet me give it to you straight. If you\u0026rsquo;re a nice guy, you\u0026rsquo;re going to suck at Product Management. So to help you get started, here are a few classic Steve Jobs quotes. Save them up and use them at opportune times to display your superiority.\nFor designers: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve baked a really lovely cake, but then you\u0026rsquo;ve used dog shit for frosting.\u0026rdquo; For key technology partners: \u0026ldquo;You make a lot of crap. Get rid of the crappy stuff.\u0026rdquo; For your Scrum Team: \u0026ldquo;I need all of you to resign. Or else I\u0026rsquo;m going to resign and not come back on Monday.\u0026rdquo; For the Executives: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never met one of you who didn\u0026rsquo;t suck.\u0026rdquo; For Marketing and Sales: \u0026ldquo;F*ing dickless aholes.\u0026rdquo; For your PM peers: \u0026ldquo;You guys don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u0026rdquo;\nThere you go.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the lesson?\nWhen it comes to being an effective Product Manager, there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as being too Steve-ish. Even if your loser Scrum Master calls you out in a sprint retrospective for not being a team player, you can reply with a classic Jobs retort, \u0026ldquo;You may be right. But if I succeed, remember to look in the mirror and call yourself an a**hole for me.\u0026rdquo;\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/steve-jobs/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 6: Steve Jobs","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/learning-opportunity/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Learning opportunity","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 7: Quality Assurance # If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended a rodeo, you know the highlight is the bull riding competition. The crowd greatly anticipates the moment when bull riders mount up on the back of an animal filled with murderous rage. When the signal is given, a gate opens and the bull leaps into the arena where it spins around and bucks violently while exclaiming through angry snorts, \u0026ldquo;Get of my back! Get off my back! Get off my back!\u0026rdquo; The bull rider tries to stay on the bulls back for 8 seconds.\nAs a PM, you are the bull rider.\nThe bull is your product.\nOpening the gate is your release process where you desperately hang on and hope that nothing catastrophic happens\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Everyone holds their breath. # As you build your PM career, quality will be your greatest conundrum. If you embrace quality, everyone will hate you for not getting anything done. If you ignore quality, everyone will hate you for not having anything the market can use. Regardless of what you do, everyone is going to hate you. You will then embrace the fact that you\u0026rsquo;ve made a terrible career choice\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # I remember a specific job interview where my potential new boss was an actual user of the product at my current job.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I use that product,\u0026rdquo; the potential new boss said as I tried to hide my embarrassment and shame, thinking of how I was going to weasel my way out of this one. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m having a really hard time logging in.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I, uh, only work on the part after the login,\u0026rdquo; I stammered, realizing it was the dumbest thing I had ever said\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the job. # What was I supposed to say? The truth?\nMy boss is shortsighted and demands everything be done within an unreasonably time period. Our development environments are broken and nothing can be deployed reliably. Our QA manager is a pot-smoking hippie whose only concern is the quality of his weed. None of these matter. As long as you have a product in the market, a product manager is judged by quality and nothing else.\nYet ironically, to get a product to market, you gotsta get paid. And usually getting paid is the result of a mandate like this from an executive:\n\u0026ldquo;We finally have a paying customer but they think our product is real and I told them it would be ready next week.\u0026rdquo;\nUh oh. Now your skills as a Product Manager are under pressure. Do you have enough clout to push back against the executive? Do you have enough goodwill with the dev teams to request a ridiculous favor? Do you have enough PTO days to go on vacation and get away from this problem?\nIt always ends the same way.\nBy executive mandate to make this happen, you now must bribe some engineers to hack up something over the weekend. Yes, it makes you sick to compromise and take shortcuts. Yes, It makes you sick to think of the unhealthy amount of Monster Engergy Drinks you are about to consume. But what makes you most sick is that you will be dealing with this decision for the rest of your now pathetic days at this job. Sure, you try to find consolation by telling yourself this is only temporary and you will \u0026ldquo;productize\u0026rdquo; it later\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you never get the chance. # Why?\nBecause more client promises are made and more features are built on this compromised solution. The next thing you know you have an entire product and business built around what was essentially a weekend hackathon fueled by caffeine and self-loathing. And that\u0026rsquo;s your foundation of quality for the next 5 years.\nEvery profitable software company in existence shares this exact same story.\nThe most ironic thing in all of this is that there will be someone in your company with the job title of QA. These poor people. They are essentially the equivalent of pedestrian signals in New York City. Sure, they exist as warnings, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t keep you from crossing whenever the hell you feel like it. Cars honk, taxi drivers swear, but you march forward in oblivion.\n\u0026ldquo;We strongly advise against this product release due to this list of dozens of coding and user experience issues we found,\u0026rdquo; the QA team tells you the night before a release.\n\u0026ldquo;Are any of them showstoppers?\u0026rdquo; you ask.\n\u0026ldquo;On Android, a hellish demon is released that eats the soul of our customers?\u0026rdquo; QA says.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s a low percentage that will be impacted?\u0026rdquo; you say as if you are the judge of your customers\u0026rsquo; eternal destiny. \u0026ldquo;Besides, most of our customers don\u0026rsquo;t believe in demons anyway,\u0026rdquo; you justify.\nWhether it is a soul-sucking demon or a minor CSS issue, you are the one that makes the decision to release an imperfect product\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;after all, all products are imperfect, so it\u0026rsquo;s your call, the industry-appointed CEO of the product, to determine the threshold of imperfection.\nThis means you must put on your chaps, mount your product, and ride it into the open market, hoping to stay on longer than 8 seconds\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Here we go\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;Ouch. The bull knocks you off quicker than expected.\n\u0026ldquo;Who gave the green light to release this broken feature?\u0026rdquo; The services executive barks. Every eyeball in the room turns your way and pierces you with accusation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true. You gave the green light after smoke testing the most obvious happy path on Chrome. What you forgot is that none of your customers use the software as intended and your most critical clients inexplicably use a version of Internet Explorer that not even Microsoft supports anymore.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s take this offline,\u0026rdquo; you say to the angry exec.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s fitting, because due to your incompetence, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what our application is: offline,\u0026rdquo; the exec replies.\nYou then schedule the obligatory post-mortem assessment where you try to convince everyone how valuable this experience was as a learning opportunity\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;your job is once again on the line\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;the single wringable neck.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nWhen code inevitably breaks and fails in production, you learn a lot about your organization based on who takes the blame. Of course, in good product organizations, the team works as a cohesive unit, accepting blame together and fixing the solution in unison. Good teams, spearheaded by a strong Product Manager, know it is not one person\u0026rsquo;s fault. It takes the entire high performing team to produce quality products.\nIn bad product organizations, the fingers start pointing. Designers didn\u0026rsquo;t get the designs done on time, quality assurance is lazy, product managers didn\u0026rsquo;t write enough documentation, engineers play too much ping pong, and finally everyone rallies around a common message of leadership being incompetent.\nUnfortunately, in the blame game, PMs become the easiest scapegoat. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to notice your lack of details in story descriptions.\n\u0026ldquo;The PM didn\u0026rsquo;t tell us we needed to account for demonic Android soul-sucking,\u0026rdquo; the engineers say.\nYou then try to defend yourself by saying that it should be common sense to not release devilish fiends into the world. But at this point, common sense no longer applies. You all have a heated debate about whose responsibility it is to define and write quality code and inexplicably everyone looks at you again, the least qualified person in the room to have any jurisdiction over code and the quality thereof\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;You then kick off a series of meetings to define the definition of done\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;which usually means you must document every business case, use case, test case, and marketing case in exquisite and excruciating detail\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;You\u0026rsquo;ll then wonder how you got this deep into the bowels of hell\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;You\u0026rsquo;ll then test your app for the first time, actually hoping the demon sucks your soul and you can leave this damn company\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nThe truth is that we all know the answer to quality. It only requires 2 things: (1) Quality must be at the top of company values and then (2) you must build teams around people who give a crap.\nOn the other hand, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have good motivated people then by all means, come up with a rigorous process that treats people like factory cogs and completely removes any essence of personal motivation, pride in work, or crap givingness.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nThe lesson is that only great people can create great products and high performing teams will only release quality products. As the Product Manger, it is not your job to define done. It is your responsibility to lead product teams so that they own it together, collaborate together, and produce valuable quality products together.\nIn these conditions, even though every product release will continue to feel like opening the chute and riding a chaotic bull, at least you\u0026rsquo;ll have a high chance of putting on a good show for the crowd and winning the competition.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/quality-assurance/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 7: Quality Assurance","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/i-hate-rules/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"I hate rules","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 8: Roadmaps # When I was somewhat younger during the ancient period called pre-iphonean, our family went on a vacation where we rented a Lincoln Town Car. Back then Hertz proudly offered a miraculous invention known as NeverLost. It was new innovative tech, and as far as GPS goes by today\u0026rsquo;s standards\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it sucked. # You had to plan your entire fiasco of a trip around the whimsical nature of clouds because any amount of overcast would entirely block the GPS signal.\n\u0026ldquo;I see a tiny stratus cloud up there,\u0026rdquo; my dad would say as the Neverlost flickered in and out of connectivity. \u0026ldquo;Welp, we\u0026rsquo;re lost.\u0026rdquo;\nWe spent much of our vacation pulled over on the side of the road, waiting for connectivity. The fact that it was called Neverlost was a joke because you spent most of the time being lost. Perhaps \u0026ldquo;AlwaysLost\u0026rdquo; would have been a more accurate name\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but admittedly it would have been terrible PR\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;like the poor Samsung marketer who has to convince people their phone isn\u0026rsquo;t going to catch on fire\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;The Samsung Neverfire # As for the Neverlost, even with its less-than-reliable GPS signal, at that moment in the early timeline of GPS history, Neverlost was one of the coolest inventions we had ever seen\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and as a bonus, it didn\u0026rsquo;t catch on fire. 🔥🔥🔥 # My father, on the other hand, glowed like a fiery ember as he marveled at the modern wonders of new technology. About every 10 minutes he would look at the paperback atlas and say, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need you\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;That poor paperback Atlas is still attending therapy sessions to deal with abandonment issues. # The Hertz Neverlost was my first real experience with a roadmap in that it provided directions and told us where to go.\nI mean, that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;d think a roadmap is supposed to do, right?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which brings us to the Product Roadmap. # Like the Neverlost, the product roadmap is supposed to provide clarity and direction. It is supposed to tell you where to go. Yet most of the time you are dealing with conditions out of your control like those mother f***ing stratus clouds, not to mention other surprises along the way:\npotholes == bugs kids screaming from the backseat == client demands road construction detours == new sales contracts the occasional herd of cattle blocking the road == legal compliance frivolous site seeing adventures == executive whims And regardless of the obvious absurdity of it all, every leader in your organization will pretend like none of this happens and expect you to produce an unrealistic product roadmap that has the equivalent accuracy and technological prowess of today\u0026rsquo;s Google Maps.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me exactly where this product is going, when we will get there, and where we can get food along the way,\u0026rdquo; your CEO will say\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Uh oh. # In this lesson we are going to discuss why the typical roadmap is a stupid idea and the only thing it does is pave a road to failure\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # Seriously, if making software was as easy as making a Gantt chart of uninterrupted step-by-step procedures to a final delivery date, then we would print it out like the old-school Mapquest instructions:\n\u0026ldquo;Start out going North on UX street. Merge onto Agile Ceremony HWY. Turn right at DEV BLVD. Exit the QA ramp. End at Your Delivery Destination.\u0026rdquo;\nUnfortunately, how many times have we tried to follow the printed out directions but we end up abandoned on some desolate dirt road with a flat tire and no gas\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Leaving you with the only viable solution of hitchhiking to another initiative\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;only to realize you hitchhiked with a psychotic ax murderer\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and he\u0026rsquo;s going to murder your career. # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nTo be clear, when I rant against the roadmap, I\u0026rsquo;m speaking out against the Gantt-chart inspired roadmaps. You know the kind where each phase is broken into step-by-step procedures. These are usually the unintended consequence of an uninformed demand by some unknowing executive who thinks product creation is unequivocally a factory assembly line of uninterrupted linear process\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;how un-true.\nInstead of clear Mapquest instructions, how many times have you followed this 10 step roadmap strategy?\nStep 1: Ideation Step 2: Design Step 3: Start Developing Prematurely Step 4: $#!+, the design doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense Step 5: Remorse that Phase 2 is over Step 6: Develop a senseless product anyway Step 7: Uh oh. We don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s a market for this Step 8: We\u0026rsquo;ve invested too much at this point. Just get it done Step 9: There\u0026rsquo;s never any time for QA Step 10: Deliver an over-engineered piece of garbage nobody wants This is the status quo. Not the exception. And it is always the PMs fault\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;It ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nOnce you realize that a procedural roadmap is just a delusional false sense of security that never works out, you\u0026rsquo;ll kick it to the curb.\n\u0026ldquo;Get out of my car!\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll yell at your roadmap. \u0026ldquo;Where we\u0026rsquo;re going we don\u0026rsquo;t need roads.\u0026rdquo;\n#nameThatMovie\nThe overly simplistic answer is that innovative product creation isn\u0026rsquo;t a sequence, it\u0026rsquo;s a collaboration. You are in the business of exploring and creating things that have never been done before. And there is no roadmap for unexplored territory\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;just ask Ferdinand Magellan, who undoubtedly was asked by his boss for a map of his adventure. # \u0026ldquo;My job is to create the map, you moron,\u0026rdquo; Ferdinand thought to himself.\nUnder duress, however, Ferdinand was forced by the moron to chart out some bogus coordinates for the sake of an upcoming leadership meeting. Then, after sending it to his boss in whatever the 16th century equivalent was for Power Point (maybe Charter Point), he privately wondered how the future of his mission could have any success under such idiotic leadership. He set sail anyway, knowing good and well that his forcibly created roadmap was useless.\nDo you relate to this (probably true) story of Magellan, being forced to create a roadmap for which you know it has zero chance of delivery as written?\nWhy do we do this to ourselves?\nMore importantly, in a business world where overly detailed roadmaps are the expected status quo, what do we do?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Especially when we know it will only lead us to guaranteed failure and misery\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and when we know it will only lead us to sink further into the dark recesses of mental insanity\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and when we know it will only lead to us to a state of unexplainable psychosis where we paint our face like a clown and start wearing purple zoot suites\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;#weAreTheJoker. # Again I ask. So what do we do?\nThe first thing you do is make a version of a f***ing roadmap. Don\u0026rsquo;t fight it too hard. You\u0026rsquo;re not some righteous revolutionary anti-roadmap crusader trying to overthrow decades of institutionalized standard operating procedures\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;keep your rebellion in your heart.\nThe lesson here is that the one big thing you can do is base your roadmap on key outcomes rather than a list of engineering projects. So instead of \u0026ldquo;Build Feature X\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s better to say \u0026ldquo;increase product adoption by X\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; or something like that. When you base your roadmap on outcomes, it invites the necessary collaboration, teamwork, and creativity to solve important business problems that actually push your product forward\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you\u0026rsquo;ll rally the team around solving problems instead of asking people to mindlessly complete tasks.\nThe lesson here is to start by turning your roadmap into outcomes. It will open up dialogue on the best way to get there, which will significantly increase your chances of getting cross-functional buy-in.\nThat way, when a tiny cirrus cloud completely scrambles your Neverlost, which is guaranteed to happen, you can rally the troops to find a creative and innovative path to your destination\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which sometimes might even mean opening up that old paperback atlas\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and no, this is not a sponsored blog post for Rand McNalley\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;although if they want to give me money\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I will take it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;balls in your court, Rand.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/roadmaps/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 8: Roadmaps","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/the-platform/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"The platform","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 9: The CRY Principle # Engineers are smart. Product Managers are dumb\u0026hellip;.\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s a well-established fact within all the tech circles\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you know which tech circles I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, the ones that revolve around programming memes.\nThis is because Product Managers don\u0026rsquo;t think like programmers. Programmers learn basic principles of their profession and typically feel these principles should be extended to every facet of life. Take for example the DRY principle. DRY stands for \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself.\u0026rdquo; After all, that\u0026rsquo;s what programming is for, right? Anything that needs to be done more than once should be programmed\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s what makes the world go \u0026lsquo;round these days\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I mean, just try to imagine how annoyingly primitive things were 20 years ago when you were forced to have meaningful conversations with a couple really good friends. You might even have to tell the same story twice to a different group of friends. But now. Think how far we have come to be able to blast out a bunch of nonsensical drivel to a list of bottomless followers and hashtag bot watchers?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Only a programming principle like DRY could have thunk up such a glorious world. # So by most measures of programming logic such as DRY, Product Managers are less-evolved forms of life\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;We like to do everything multiple times like an idiot. # Unlike programmers, Product Managers follow the CRY principle, which stands for \u0026ldquo;Constantly Repeat Yourself\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and oh yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna make you wanna cry\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nProduct Managers live between 2 opposite worlds of executives and developers. It\u0026rsquo;s like that Powerman 5000 song \u0026ldquo;When Worlds Collide\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with that song, then you unfortunately did not experience the 90s, a glorious era when people still had hope and optimism\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and yes, even meaningful face-to-face conversations with actual friends. # So as these worlds collide, you are stuck in the middle, basically a professional translator between two foreign parties who don\u0026rsquo;t know how to speak the other\u0026rsquo;s language and don\u0026rsquo;t even want to try. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to facilitate the communication.\nIf you are unaware of how to effectively translate between the two parties, then, as a Product Manager, you\u0026rsquo;re going to end up like Jack Skellington, giving out man-eating wreaths and killer jack-in-the-boxes as Christmas toys, thinking you are doing a good job.\n\u0026ldquo;I created this amazing report for you,\u0026rdquo; a naive product manager says to the VP of Operations. \u0026ldquo;All you have to do is log into JIRA and click through these 7 layers of navigation. Oh, and I recommend that you read this scholarly article about how story point velocity should measure complexity, not time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about I recommend that you get fired?\u0026rdquo; responds the VP, which would be the most appropriate response.\n\u0026hellip;I know. It ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nOut of the purest intentions of his or her heart, this poor product manager just followed in the erroneous footsteps of the aforementioned Jack Skellington and gave the VP of Operations a giant hungry snake as a Christmas gift\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s a little out of touch\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;if not completely terrifying\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;if not deadly.\n\u0026ldquo;Deadly?\u0026rdquo; you say.\nIndeed, my primary complaint against Agile management software is that it is killing us slowly, turning us into robotic task managers devoid of passion and life. Such monotony may be acceptable for the DRY personalities (see what I did there) of the software programming community, but product managers should have none of it.\nAs Marcus from Terminator: Salvation put nicely, \u0026ldquo;What is it that makes us human? It\u0026rsquo;s not something you can program. You can\u0026rsquo;t put it into a chip. It\u0026rsquo;s the strength of the human heart. The difference between us and machines.\u0026rdquo;\nProduct Management is the heart of the organization.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget that.\nRegardless of whatever crappy Agile tool your company has sold its soul to, whether it\u0026rsquo;s JIRA, Rally, Version One, Azure DevOps, Pivotal Tracker, Gitlab, (I\u0026rsquo;ve used them all and they all suck), it always backfires when you try to use it for more than the audience it was intended for\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which is and always should be lifeless software developers.\nExperience has taught me that nothing kills the mood of your product quite like pulling up JIRA in an executive meeting. Think of it as if you\u0026rsquo;re making out with your girlfriend/boyfriend and to spice things up, you decide to play a Miley Cyrus song\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and not one of the songs after she started twerking and riding naked on wrecking balls — ‘cuz I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are plenty of people into that — I\u0026rsquo;m talking about a song from her Hannah Montana days.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re showing off our moves, the breeze so cool,\u0026rdquo; Miley croons in the background. \u0026ldquo;Tonight you get to be a superstar\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lonely night for you, my friend.\nNow I know you have all sorts of questions about how I became so familiar with the discography of Miley Cyrus, but the point is, let\u0026rsquo;s just all agree to put JIRA in the small box where it belongs.\n\u0026ldquo;But look at this cool roadmapping feature,\u0026rdquo; an engineering director will inevitably say. All you have to do is spend 25 hours a week maintaining these 30 JIRA fields and it will display a beautiful visual of all your hopes and dreams.\u0026quot;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fall for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to give you a warning and I know you are going to ignore it. Despite my pleadings, you are going to get seduced into the deceptive logic only a logical programmer could logically provide. And it will be presented to you under the guise of DRY\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Why would you want to repeat information in 2 places,\u0026rdquo; you will undoubtedly hear. \u0026ldquo;We need to keep all this information in a single source of truth.\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\nFall\u0026hellip;\nFor\u0026hellip;\nIt.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to take you weeks, if not months, of configuring all the unmaintainable settings required to output a garbage representation of your roadmap. And then once you try to force JIRA upon your executive team, not only will they question why they still pay you for such nonsense, they will be left utterly uninspired by such a heartless vision of your product.\nListen.\nYour purpose is not to impress the executive team with how much time you wasted organizing JIRA\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s what scrum masters do.\nYour job is to convey some degree of product competency by showing you understand the goals of the business, what the product needs to achieve those goals, that you have a strategy to get there, and that yes, you know how to work with the dev team to get it done\u0026hellip;.\n\u0026hellip;and most important, that you are a real human being with a heart and soul.\n[Deep Breath] Now I\u0026rsquo;m going to perform a magic trick.\nClose your eyes.\nPicture in your mind what the typical roadmap looks like.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to read your mind and guess that you pictured one of those roadmaps with the swim lanes for each product line and a horizontal bar representing how long each initiative will take.\nDid I just read your mind?\nOf course I did.\nI know that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what you pictured. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which came first, this lackluster concept of a product vision or the software that created it. (Chicken or the egg.) Regardless, every single Agile tool will vomit out some hard boiled version of it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the lesson. Don\u0026rsquo;t force this bullsh*t on your organization. Use JIRA as a tool to manage your list of priorities and get stuff done with developers. Let the dev teams use JIRA however they need to manage their colorless world of logical 1s and 0s.\nFor everyone else\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;start to CRY.\nI give you license to repeat yourself and adapt your message appropriately for the audience. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to repeat a more relatable version of your product vision outside of your Agile development tool.\nGo for it. Create something meaningful that\u0026rsquo;s worth sharing. Put your heart into it. Dare to have a personality. Use your vision to get people motivated and excited about the direction of the product\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to tell you what format to use. Throughout my career, depending on the executive team\u0026rsquo;s taste, I\u0026rsquo;ve used everything from Powerpoint, to videos stories, to fancy excel spreadsheets, to comics, to Google Docs, to a wall mural. In the end, people in the organization want you to do what they had in their mind when hired you, which is lead the product with passion and vision.\nSo yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s time to CRY and create your message for 2 audiences\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;a backlog in JIRA for developers and something more powerful for everyone else.\nWhen it comes to communicating your product vision, it\u0026rsquo;s like Hannah Montana once sang, \u0026ldquo;No limitations on imagination. Imagine that. Woo. Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\nFeel free to use that lyric in your next executive meeting.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/the-cry-principle/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 9: The Cry Principle","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/college-degree/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"College degree","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 10: The Scorecard # Remember baseball cards\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I do\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which puts me in an age bracket approaching the steep precipice of irrelevancy in software development. # But this much I will tell you. If you never had a baseball card collection, then you know nothing about stack ranking according to a weighted score\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;nothing!\nMe and my friends would spend countless hours arranging our cards in priority order based upon key stats such as Home Runs, RBIs, ERA, etc. We created sophisticated ranking algorithms that would put the Facebook newsfeed to shame.\n\u0026ldquo;Does the Earned Run Average and Base on Balls of Roger Clemens supersede the Slugging Percentage and Grounded Into Double Play of Barry Bonds?\u0026rdquo; I would frequently ask my friend Zach.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter,\u0026rdquo; he would say. \u0026ldquo;At least not when you compare it to their PED to red blood cell ratio.\u0026rdquo;\nWe would then trade cards according to perceived value. Don Mattingly was in the upper tier of cards and could be traded for a seemingly equivalent card such as Cal Ripken Jr.\nAnd then there were the Ken Griffey Jr. cards — which held such an impossibly high value where the trades transcended the realm of sports.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll trade you this Ken Griffey Jr. card for your Sega Genesis,\u0026rdquo; I remember attempting a few times in my young baseball card trading career.\nWhen I first became a Product Manager and was asked to stack rank a list of business priorities, I smugly thought to myself:\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all you want me to do? This is going to be a piece of cake. This task doesn\u0026rsquo;t even involve an older brother trying to steal my cards.\u0026rdquo;\nI thought the system of ranking and scoring would translate to a list of my well-thought-out priorities that the business would gladly accept and the developers would gladly implement in sequential order.\nAt least, that\u0026rsquo;s what all the blog articles had told me would happen\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;oh boy\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I not-so-gladly am here to say: it was all a lie\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nI have a 5-step hierarchy of effective methods for product discovery, persuasion, and priority.\nThe top 4 are pretty decent methods:\nPrototypes Observation Interviews Whiteboarding If done right, these methods all involve at least some form of market and user interaction.\nAnd then\u0026hellip;\nThere is a huge gap between these methods and scorecard ranking.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like you\u0026rsquo;re asked to rate the coolness of your favorite Marvel Superheroes. You\u0026rsquo;re given a list with Ironman, Thor, Wolverine, and Hulk. And then at the end of the list you see Captain Ultra.\n\u0026ldquo;Who the hell is Captain Ultra?\u0026rdquo; you say to yourself.\n\u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t there be another choice like Deadpool or Rocket Raccoon or something like that?\u0026rdquo;\nUpon proper research, you learn that Captain Ultra was a former plumber mysteriously given powers without any real backstory — but for some reason, he developed a crippling fear of fire.\nIn one of the more obscure Marvel episodes, Captain Ultra once fainted because he saw a harmless little flame.\n\u0026ldquo;What a lame superhero,\u0026rdquo; you conclude.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean, dealing with fire and explosions is kind of a job requirement for superheroes, is it not?\u0026rdquo;\nYou then imagine what a movie about Captain Ultra would be like — the only equivalent comparison you can make is Sleepless in Seattle.\nSuffice it to say:\nScorecard stack ranking is the Captain Ultra of prioritization and persuasion methods\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s lame. # And of course, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprise any of us that it\u0026rsquo;s the most popular method espoused in product management communities.\nA quick Google search of \u0026ldquo;Product Management Scorecard\u0026rdquo; brings back no less than 17 million results in less than three-quarters of a second\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Trust me when I say I\u0026rsquo;ve read them all — and each one gets lamer and lamer than the one that came before it.\nThe reason the scorecard is so popular is because it\u0026rsquo;s a lazy way to not actually have to do real product management.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any work.\n\u0026ldquo;Sit at your desk, don\u0026rsquo;t talk to anyone, and assign some arbitrary number value to this list of items,\u0026rdquo; every article practically says.\n\u0026ldquo;Then present it to your executive team and bask in their unending praise of your skill and intelligence\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;ooh. How alluring? # Some methodologies, such as Scaled Agile, have taken this lifeless scoring method to the extreme with a cult-like ideology called WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which is even less effective for prioritizing than WWJD. # Ok.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t write about anything I haven\u0026rsquo;t personally experienced.\nHere was my first experience with scorecard ranking:\nI isolated myself for a few hours and assigned some meaningless values to my backlog items.\nI then showed it to our CEO (it was a small company) to get his feedback.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh.

We want a trendy scoring system too that can live side by side with your really rad story point estimates.\u0026rdquo;\nNot the kind to be outdone in coolness by a bunch of nerds, product people came up with the scorecard\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and that\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;m guessing WSJF spawned from hell into existence. # Look\u0026hellip;\nIf I have to convince you that:\nFiguring out the effort of engineering development and figuring out the value of a product idea are not the same thing\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Product Management might not be the career for you. # Here\u0026rsquo;s the lesson:\nIf you need to go through an exercise of scorecard ranking for your own information gathering and educational purposes, then go for it.\nIt can be personally valuable to understand what really matters to your business:\nIs the idea to increase revenue?

What a lying psychopath. I hope she burns in hell.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then the next day I did the exact same thing at our company Sprint Review\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;just on a much lesser scale.\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about the illusion we call \u0026ldquo;The Making Progress Demo during the stakeholder sprint review\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and yes, when it comes to this particular demo, we are all lying psychopaths who deserve to burn in hell\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nLike Elizabeth Holmes, you likely have the best intentions to create a real product. It all starts the same way. The project gets kicked off, plans get presented, commitments get made, and business strategies get formed, all supported by a PowerPoint template with some cool slide transitions.\nAfter the kickoff when all the stakeholders agree that the slide transitions were indeed very cool, they leave it up to you to deliver the product as presented\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; so easy\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;right?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;right??????\u0026hellip;. # And so you immediately dive in and start working with your team to build your product. At this stage there is so much hope and optimism, so much inspiration and passion, so much pride and cockiness.\n\u0026ldquo;I just got everyone to believe in my idea,\u0026rdquo; you think to yourself. \u0026ldquo;Correction \u0026hellip; I just got everyone to believe in me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe thrill of megalomania and narcissism flows through your veins as if you are gaining Superman powers under the glowing rays of an earthly yellow sun.\nLike Superman, the otherworldly powers you receive are bestowed upon you when the executive team designates your project as having received \u0026ldquo;the green light.\u0026rdquo;\nSuperman has the yellow sun. Product Managers have the green light.\nBut regardless of the color from whence your powers originate, you stand tall and immovable, ready to conquer the world of product management, if not eliminate evil altogether. Overcome by emotion and self-aggrandizement, you rip open your business-casual button-up shirt to reveal the S of Superman scrawled across your puffed out chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Dude, what are you doing? Put your shirt back on,\u0026rdquo; your colleague whispers to you, seeing nothing but an exposed, out-of-shape, and rather ungroomed chest\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you receive a few emails from HR later on that day\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;you also receive an email from your colleague to subscribe to Manscaped.\nThis product management high continues for a while. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t until you start doing Sprint Reviews that you realize how much of a fraud you are. Based on what you told them, stakeholders expect demoes of your product. They expect momentum. They expect results\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;oh yeah. There are a lot of expectations\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nThe problem arrives when the honeymoon kickoff period wears off and it\u0026rsquo;s time to start showing progress. You suddenly realize that you don\u0026rsquo;t actually have anything real to demo.\nWhenever the development team is in this situation, they will try to convince you that the most important thing to demonstrate is that you are \u0026ldquo;making progress.\u0026rdquo; The team doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to reveal the fact that they have no idea how to take this product to market in the scary world of production.\nThey want to delay that reality as long as possible.\nSo you capitulate to this concept of \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how your path in the footsteps of Elizabeth Holmes starts. Like her, you learn that any skilled magician can pull off the illusion that \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo; is the actual product itself.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I demo the product at Sprint Review?\u0026rdquo; you will ask the dev team millions of times throughout your career\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and 99% of the time you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;well, at least not in the way of doing a demo of a real product.\n\u0026ldquo;The code only works on this obscure local machine and only in this even more obscure development environment,\u0026rdquo; the team replies.\n\u0026ldquo;And how do I get access to that?\u0026rdquo; you ask.\nThe team gives you a 45-page instruction manual of how to VPN into some ultra-secure development environment, which apparently has the same level of security that NASA uses to hide big secrets\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;like satellite imagery of the whereabouts of Bigfoot. # \u0026ldquo;Is this how our users are going to access the product?\u0026rdquo; you think to yourself, but are too embarrassed to ask the developers. This forces you to put an illogical and unfounded trust in the developer, betting against all odds that he hasn\u0026rsquo;t infected his hard drive with all sorts of dirty anime porn.\nYou finally figure out how to piece a demo together so that you can pretend your product is \u0026ldquo;making progress.\u0026rdquo;\nOn demo day, you get up in front of the stakeholders and demonstrate your product with such mastery and skill it leaves everyone in awe of the awesomeness of your totally awesome product. They heap comments of praise upon you and the team and the the impact this product is going to have on the business.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, this feels good,\u0026rdquo; you admit to yourself. \u0026ldquo;The dev team was right. All I have to do is demonstrate I am \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo; and perfect my salesmanship.\u0026rdquo;\nYou feel the urge to rip open your shirt again and reveal your Superman logo, but previous experience has taught you to restrain such impulses\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you decide to save that exhibition for tonight in front of a full length mirror.\nSprint after sprint, you go through this dog and pony show\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;only that real dogs and real ponys would be infinitely more valuable to the organization.\nOk.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pause now.\nAnd let me ask you\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;How are you any better than Elizabeth Holmes? # All she did was perfect \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo; and was better at it than you or anyone else. She was the Wonder Woman of The \u0026ldquo;Making Progress\u0026rdquo; Demo\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and you\u0026rsquo;re no Wonder Woman.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the lesson: don\u0026rsquo;t step in \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo; bull crap. You need to demo more than \u0026ldquo;making progress.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t let the dev team convince you to settle for \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo; demoes only available on their local machines. Product Managers are not here to make dev teams feel good about accomplishing nothing. You need to demo the actual product the way a user would use it. Make sure the dev team understands that you are a representative of the market and the business. The only thing that matters is a real product in the real world for real people\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;anything other than a real product is just a less perfected version of Theranos\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and if you succumb to just \u0026ldquo;making progress\u0026rdquo;, then you are a lying psychopath who deserves to burn in hell. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/product-demos/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 11: Product Demos","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/air-jira/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Air jira","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 12: Scope Creep # Creep is such an insulting word. I dare you to try and use the word creep in any of its parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective) with a positive connotation.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you take this creep to be your lawfully wedded husband?\u0026rdquo;\nNope.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s creep over to the party tonight.\u0026rdquo;\nNope.\n\u0026ldquo;Creepy Birthday to You!\u0026rdquo;\nNope.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nSo it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t surprise you that there is a term in software development that uses this devilish word to denote the most hideous thing that can happen to any development initiative\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;m talking about scope creep. # It\u0026rsquo;s an act so sinful that that even Moses struggled with what should be the 10th commandment.\n\u0026ldquo;I have a tough decision to make,\u0026rdquo; he thought to himself upon Mt. Sanai. \u0026ldquo;Thou Shalt Not Covet or Thou Shalt Not Scope Creep\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Let\u0026rsquo;s be real, people have been stoned to death for much less grievous offenses than scope creep. # Now it would be one thing if scope creep was a term generally used for all the people and all the situations it could be applied to. But trust me, such a damning word like scope creep is reserved for and mentioned only in context of the instigators of insidiousness, those wretched Product Managers\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;in the software development world, only an unworthy and unforgiven Product Manager could do something so evil and horrific as welcome changing requirements even late in development for the customer\u0026rsquo;s competitive advantage\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Of course this is actually just Agile Principle #2. Yet ironically you will get hissed and booed for simply following the very agile methodology that the booers and hissers forced upon you.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy. # I was introduced to scope creep with my very first project as a new, naïve, and innocent product manager. We were working on a meaningless feature for an even more meaningless customer. Back then I was dumb enough to think that my job was to solve market problems for the value of the business, so I suggested a simple addition to the feature that would make the product infinitely more valuable for all our customers instead of just this one narrow isolated use case.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s scope creep,\u0026rdquo; I was told bluntly by the engineer working on the project.\nAnd that pretty much ended the conversation.\nWhen developers and scrum taskmasters utter the words \u0026ldquo;scope creep\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s like using a Jedi mind trick to convince product managers that the customers really don\u0026rsquo;t need that feature.\n\u0026ldquo;These are not the features you are looking for,\u0026rdquo; they say as they wave their hands in a wiping motion across your face. \u0026ldquo;These are scope creep,\u0026rdquo; they wave their hand back the other way\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you wonder what all the hand waving is about but somewhere deep inside you get a cold empty feeling in your heart as if you just realized you are turning into a Sith Lord of the dark side, introducing evil and nefarious scope creep into an otherwise pure galaxy of blissful software utopia.\n\u0026ldquo;Am I evil?\u0026rdquo; you ask yourself, repeating the words of a Diamond Head song\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;I am man yes I am.\u0026rdquo; # Back then I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what scope creep was. This was before I had memorized the entire encyclopedia of rote agile definitions, doctrine, and dogma. All I knew was that scope creep was bad and that this was a topic not open to discussion, akin to \u0026ldquo;he who must not be named\u0026rdquo; in Harry Potter\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;only \u0026ldquo;he who introduces scope creep\u0026rdquo; is a person considered to be much, much more sinister.\nSincerely, I\u0026rsquo;ve been living in fear of Scope Creep ever since that day with the same irrational fear that some have of a psychotic clown living in the rain sewers\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;if scope creep had a face, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it would look like Pennywise. # \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m every nightmare you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had!\u0026rdquo;\nWell.\nHopefully by this point I\u0026rsquo;ve convinced you that you are a disgusting creep in the community of software development and the only thing you have to contribute is scope creep, which makes you an evil, evil, son of a b*tch\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the lesson, and here\u0026rsquo;s how this is all going to play out for you.\nThe dev team is going to look at your backlog of thousands of items and commit to getting a project done by a certain date. Because they are terrible at estimating, they are going to completely fail at hitting that deadline. With this realization, it is now going to be your job to \u0026ldquo;reduce scope\u0026rdquo; in order to meet the time commitment\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;this will happen on every development initiative for the entire duration of your pathetic career in product management.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the twist you need to watch out for. The dev team is going to play mind games with you and try to convince you that the items you take out were actually just scope creep to begin with\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;oh the ingenuity of those sneaky bastards. # I mean, logically, if you are now willing to take those items out of the MVP in order to hit a launch date, then they must not be that important. In other words\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you\u0026rsquo;re just really bad at your job and should have known better than to have ever added those features in the first place\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Can\u0026rsquo;t you see the dev team all tapping their fingers together like Mr. Burns and saying in a mischievously manipulating voice, \u0026ldquo;Excellent\u0026rdquo;?\nThe team will also convince you that it is now your job to simply prioritize any future work that might be done on this stripped-down product\u0026hellip;\n..the word \u0026ldquo;iterate\u0026rdquo; gets thrown out a lot in these circumstances.\n\u0026ldquo;We will just iterate on the MVP after we launch it,\u0026rdquo; the dev team tells you even though they have zero comprehension of how overpromised your roadmap is and that there simply isn\u0026rsquo;t any time to iterate on features they should have already built\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;at this point you make a circle with your right hand and explain to the dev in a perfect imitation of that Lord of the Rings guy, \u0026ldquo;One does not simply iterate on a product release.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;yeah, the organization is expecting you to move on to the next thing.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you set the priorities, so just decide what is most important you,\u0026rdquo; they tell you so nonchalantly that it fills you with all sorts of conflicting emotions of anger and humiliation\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and that\u0026rsquo;s when you realize you\u0026rsquo;ve been had. # With craftiness and wizardry the dev team has just transferred their entire failure to deliver onto your shoulders. You now have the weight of deciding whether you are going to \u0026ldquo;iterate\u0026rdquo; and put your entire roadmap in jeopardy or just release a subpar application and move on.\n\u0026ldquo;How did this just happen?\u0026rdquo; you ask yourself as your shoulders start to ache from holding up such a heavy burden.\nThe dev team goes to the bar after work to celebrate their successful product release.\nSo what do we do?\nWhat do we do?\nUnfortunately, I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how not to be a creep in this business of product management. You will automatically be considered a creep no matter what you do\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;either holding people to their commitments\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;or introducing scope creep for mission critical items.\nHaving been a creep my entire career, here\u0026rsquo;s what I now do to help me navigate the spells and curses that the dev team witches and warlocks try to cast upon me. For any initiative, I clearly communicate to all stakeholders, developers, and engineering management, \u0026ldquo;The 3 Things That Matter\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and I force myself to stick to a list of only 3 things\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;because that\u0026rsquo;s all anybody can actually remember.\nMany product managers fall into the trap of trying to communicate with backlog items, and story points, and burn downs, and blah blah blah.\n\u0026ldquo;We have completed 4000 points out of 20 million,\u0026rdquo; you say at sprint review as if it is supposed to make any sense at all.\nTrying to estimate and communicate a backlog of hundreds of work items and thousands of points fails every time. It always results in you becoming the creep.\nSo focus on The 3 Things That Matter. The 3 Things That Matter are just 3 high level business objectives. Then I make sure that everyone understands that the success of a given initiative is dependent on accomplishing those 3 things\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;or\u0026hellip; if you only accept vocabulary that is defined within the rigid glossaries of scrum.org, I think they call this the \u0026ldquo;Product Goal\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; and I\u0026rsquo;m sure they have an 80 page instruction guide on how to create a simple product goal\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;along with a cult you can join to pledge your undying allegiance to scrum. # But whether you belong to a scrum cult or not, the most important aspect of a product manager\u0026rsquo;s job is to make sure you clearly communicate each sprint how the development work is progressing to achieve the 3 Things That Matter for your product.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s ultimately up to the team to figure out HOW to achieve those goals. This will give the team the flexibility to figure out their own scope creep as needed to accomplish the goals they committed to\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be such a creep.\nAnd if they fail, well\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just 3 things guys,\u0026rdquo; you say. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re telling me you couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to achieve 3 simple things.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;That\u0026rsquo;s right, who\u0026rsquo;s the ingenious sneaky bastard now\u0026hellip; # Just remember that your job isn\u0026rsquo;t to deliver a list of story points by a deadline. Your job as a product manager is to create value and change the world. You do this by focusing on solving problems for users in your market and working with the team to achieve business outcomes.\nNow go get the team to rally around The 3 Things That Matter\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and creepy luck to you. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/scope-creep/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 12: Scope Creep","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/go-back-a-slide/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Go back a slide","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 13: Just Say No # Dare I admit I\u0026rsquo;m old enough to remember the D.A.R.E. program.

Without an army of software programmers fueled by weed and Redbull, there would be no technological advancements.\n\u0026ldquo;Dude, I totally know what we should do,\u0026rdquo; a young programmer once said to his friend as he took a hit from the bong. \u0026ldquo;We should like make it easier to hook up with chicks without having to talk to them.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;A few weeks later, Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook. # The D.A.R.E. program made its own attempt at innovation by creating a famous slogan: Just Say No.\n\u0026ldquo;Just say no?\u0026rdquo; we all questioned.\nObviously we were confused. As a kid in the early 90s, if you idolized Michael Jordan, which we all did, you were also exposed to a very expensive marketing campaign by Nike. They were advertising everywhere to \u0026ldquo;Just Do It\u0026rdquo;.\nI remember at the D.A.R.E assembly we were all handed \u0026ldquo;Just Say No\u0026rdquo; t-shirts. I promptly took my \u0026ldquo;Just Say No\u0026rdquo; t-shirt and put it on over the top of my \u0026ldquo;Just Do It\u0026rdquo; t-shirt\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;No wonder my generation is so screwed up and mentally incapacitated. # This brings us to Product Management. When the Agile movement started infesting the technology landscape like a biblical plague of locusts, the developers were faced with a tough dilemma.\n\u0026ldquo;We want to do as little as we possibly can,\u0026rdquo; the writers of the Agile Manifesto discussed. \u0026ldquo;How can we make that happen?\u0026rdquo;\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a knock on Agile. It\u0026rsquo;s actually common sense. We should all try to do as little as we possibly can while still providing value. Software is always better when you eliminate all the clunky waste. We all know it\u0026rsquo;s true that most of our development effort is spent trying to satisfy a tiny portion of our audience.\n\u0026ldquo;But this one customer hinted that they perhaps might be less than 100% satisfied with our software,\u0026rdquo; the customer support team will say every day of your career. Comments like this will launch quarter-long initiatives to increase the satisfaction of that one customer from you-guys-suck to you-guys-still-suck.\nThis is why one of the principles of Agile became \u0026ldquo;Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m really surprised this principle hasn\u0026rsquo;t turned into another more realistic acronym like W.E.A.S.L.E\u0026hellip;.\n\u0026hellip;We \u0026hellip; Ehh \u0026hellip; Are Slow Lazy Engineers. # \u0026hellip;#TBH\nThe point is that while maximizing the amount of work not done is an important software development principle, the developers never had any intention of being part of it.\n\u0026ldquo;This part of the job blows,\u0026rdquo; every developer colluded. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s give this responsibility to a lesser form of life that doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to write code.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how the Product Manager job came to be\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;well, not exactly\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but that\u0026rsquo;s how the Agile development community views it.\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nAll of this adds up to a role being invented (the product owner) to take on the responsibility of just saying no\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and like D.A.R.E\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;no one listens to that crappy slogan. # Yet, trust me, if a know-it-all PM ever offers advice on how to be a product manager, \u0026ldquo;Just Say No\u0026rdquo; is always in the top 3 of \u0026ldquo;things I wish I\u0026rsquo;d known when I started as a PM\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;which literally for them was probably about 6 months ago\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it goes right along with other useless generic tips like \u0026ldquo;Know Your Market\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Have A Vision\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Aside: The acronym for Have A Vision would be HAV, as in HAV a vision. worse acronyms than this have become extremely famous \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m talking to you WWW.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the problem with saying no: you suck at it and nobody wants to hear it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Ouch,\u0026rdquo; you say as you try to console your injured pride. Well as blunt as this sounds, it\u0026rsquo;s actually supported by data. It\u0026rsquo;s no wonder product managers get such terrible survey results from business leaders.\n\u0026ldquo;So how would you rate your product manager?\u0026rdquo; the survey asks. \u0026ldquo;On a scale of 10 to Just-Says-No-All-the-Time.\u0026rdquo;\nSeriously. Would you want to be around your sorry-sniveling-say-no self?\nLet me guess your answer\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;No!\n\u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m just doing what all the popular product management articles tell me to do,\u0026rdquo; you argue.\nWell, those articles were written by a bunch of idiots.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the lesson.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t say no.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m going to give you some time to let your heart rate and blood pressure return to a healthy level.]\n\u0026ldquo;But\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; I can hear you stammering.\nI know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. \u0026ldquo;But\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; but\u0026hellip; this is my job, right?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, I completely agree with the principle of maximizing the amount of work not done. I will always say that a badass half is better than a halfass whole.\nBut who are you to decide what is badass? Who are you to say \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;? Have you really earned that much trust and clout in the organization where everyone trusts you to be the sole arbiter of product truth.\nI like to picture this type of product manager up on the golden throne of the product kingdom. Weak little peasants like the CEO and the COO crawl up to the footstool, trembling and begging for the product manager to have mercy upon them and to accept just one tiny 3 point story into the backlog. Of course, King KON (King Of No) dismisses them without even hearing the use case.\n\u0026ldquo;My job is to say No!\u0026rdquo; you yell. \u0026ldquo;Off with their heads!\u0026rdquo; you order their execution\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;King KON may be my best acronym invention so far. # And, yes, I know if you were to actually write it out, it would be King King Of No. But doesn\u0026rsquo;t this make it even that much better. This type of kingly product manager is so arrogant they put the word King in their job title not once\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but twice.\n\u0026ldquo;My job is to say no!!!!\u0026rdquo;, they stomp around, beat their chest and roar with the might of King KON!!!!!\nWhenever I hear product managers talk about the principle of saying no, they usually say something silly like, \u0026ldquo;They just won\u0026rsquo;t take no for an answer.\u0026rdquo; Or, yes, the cringeworthy, \u0026ldquo;Its my job to say no.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be clear. Despite what the Agile overlords tell you, your job is not to say no. Your job is to build and deliver badass shit.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re just coming to work firing off the word \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; like a reckless outlaw in a western movie, then expect the sheriff to run you out of town or at least reduce your authority by putting you in some kind of socially inept jail for losers with no tact.\nOk.\nI know you are struggling with this lesson. Your entire sandy foundation of product management has been washed away. So let me give you the criteria for when you can say \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;, both of which must be met.\nThe organization trusts you.\nYou are really, really, really confident in the things you are doing and can persuasively articulate your product vision so that when people hear the word \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, it makes sense to them\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;yes, that\u0026rsquo;s 3 really superlatives to underscore the importance of where your confidence level needs to be.\nSo if the organization trusts you and you\u0026rsquo;re really, really, really confident, then by all means say \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\nFor example, when people had good ideas at Apple in 2006, Steve Jobs could say, \u0026ldquo;No, we are going to focus on the iPhone.\u0026rdquo;\nFor the rest of us, we just have to be better at listening to all the ideas, giving people the attention they deserve, and then communicating reality in an enthusiastic, charismatic, and charming way\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;sigh\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nThis is an attitude thing, y\u0026rsquo;all.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying you have to actually commit to do everything. I know the facts. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to do everything. No product manager wants to be associated with that other overused cliché \u0026ldquo;overpromise and underdeliver\u0026rdquo;. And unfortunately you\u0026rsquo;re not Doctor Strange who can bend the universal laws of time, space and thermodynamics.\nThis means you are faced with the very real constraints of time, money, and all-too-often talent.\nThat being said, just because you face tough limitations and have the role of product owner on a scrum team, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you a non-expiring license to be an a-hole.\nJust try this instead.\nWhen you wake up in the morning, rather than putting on your D.A.R.E. \u0026ldquo;Just Say No\u0026rdquo; shirt, put on your Nike \u0026ldquo;Just Do It\u0026rdquo; shirt. Having a positive attitude, enthusiastic passion, and uplifting energy will always go further than being a negative sourpuss.\nYou want people to feel like you are on their side.\nAnd then when you build awesome stuff, you\u0026rsquo;ll earn people\u0026rsquo;s trust. When you earn people\u0026rsquo;s trust, then you\u0026rsquo;ll become more confident in your vision. And when you have trust, confidence and vision, you\u0026rsquo;ll finally be in a position of respected leadership to articulate the future of your product and say No to crappy stuff that doesn\u0026rsquo;t align.\nUntil then, stop complaining that nobody listens to you and DARE to be the kind of product manager people want to work with.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/just-say-no/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 13: Just Say No","type":"humor"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/comics/risk/","section":"Comics","summary":"","title":"Risk","type":"comics"},{"content":" Lesson 14: Full-stack Developer # I recently read an article debating whether Superman or Spectre was more powerful. A poll was taken and an overwhelming amount of nerds voted in favor of Spectre.\nIt makes sense.\nSpectre is granted limitless power by The Presence (DC Comics version of God) to accomplish any feat within his imagination\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s kinda hard to beat that. # If that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, he also has the ability to alter reality. He can warp time and space or shapeshift however he pleases. Another arrow in the ol\u0026rsquo; superpower quiver.\nOh yeah. And he has all the knowledge in the universe. And not just the universe we know. Spectre has all the knowledge from all the universes that may have been subjected to a time distortion.\nTrust me. You ain\u0026rsquo;t gettin\u0026rsquo; anything by that guy.\nIn one particular episode, Spectre even made The Joker feel remorse which was thought to have been impossible\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;nuff said. # So it should come as no surprise that every leader in every tech company is looking for the Spectre engineer with all the expected superpowers\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and without any further adieu, may I introduce you\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;THE FULL STACK DEVELOPER!!!!!. # In the eyes of technology leaders, the full-stack developer has basically the same abilities as Spectre.\n\u0026ldquo;What? We didn\u0026rsquo;t deliver on time?\u0026rdquo; the CEO asks. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t you just, like, travel back in time or something?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd like the comic superhero, not only is the full-stack developer all powerful\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;the full-stack developer is completely make believe\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. FSD!\u0026rdquo; we clamor. \u0026ldquo;Save us from crippling development dependencies and painfully awkward technology meetings where no decisions get made.\u0026rdquo;\nWith his uniform of a hoodie and an unkempt hipster beard, the FSD swoops in encircled by a smoke cloud of pot.\n\u0026ldquo;I have average intelligence in one specific thing and have a superficial knowledge of all things,\u0026rdquo; he exclaims. \u0026ldquo;Here I am to save the day.\u0026rdquo;\nHe eagerly gets to work.\nOnce you get to know the full-stack developer, you soon begin to realize that this person is less like a superhero and more like a villain in a Scooby Doo episode. After several sprints of disappointing releases, like Fred and Velma you start putting the puzzle pieces together.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see who is actually under this full-stack developer mask,\u0026rdquo; you say as you rip off the façade.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s actually just a regular developer,\u0026rdquo; everyone realizes the obvious.\n\u0026ldquo;And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for that meddling requirement to actually produce something,\u0026rdquo; the developer laments.\nOn one particularly useless website, the full-stack developer is described as someone who is an expert in the front end and the backend of an application. They also tend to be well versed in both business logic and user experience. They have good communication skills and their experience helps them become leaders in the organization\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;They can also breathe underwater and kick a 63 yard field goal. # At this point in my career, I have literally worked with hundreds and hundreds of engineers all over the world\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I have yet to meet a developer that fits that description.\nYet I know they are our there, lurking in the deep waters of the engineering profession like a 20 pound largemouth bass.\n\u0026ldquo;Look what we caught,\u0026rdquo; Google says. \u0026ldquo;Check out the size of this one,\u0026rdquo; Apple says. \u0026ldquo;Wow this is a biggun,\u0026rdquo; Facebook says.\nOne thing is for sure. None of these mythical full-stack developers are being lured by the bait your company is throwing in the water\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and yet\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;most likely your entire dev team strategy is based on having a pool of fat bigmouth full-stack developers\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and all you get is the overweight bigmouth part\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nThis is why a lot of companies struggle with the most basic things like CSS. As a product manager you likely repeat over and over and over, \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t it 2021? Why are we struggling with things that were solved decades ago?\u0026rdquo;\nAll too often I see that the myth of the full-stack developer wreaks its havoc on application design. In our current delineation of roles and responsibilities there is a huge gap between what we know as the typical designer and what we know as the typical engineer.\nAnd this is how things typically play out.\nA graphic designer masquerading as a UX professional makes a static mockup in a program like Photoshop or Sketch or Figma\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Aside: I really want to create a program for designers called Phetchma for designers which is just a basic text editor that upon opening says, \u0026ldquo;Learn CSS!\u0026rdquo;\nOnce the static mockups are complete, we all get to witness something really cute. The \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; designer exports the CSS from one of these programs and gives it to the engineers as if that\u0026rsquo;s what they are supposed to use.\n\u0026ldquo;You can use this if you want?\u0026rdquo; the designer says, not realizing that the CSS produced by these designer programs is completely useless in the world of actual application development.\nBut none of this matters to the engineer. They are going to spend 99% of their time, you know, engineering, programming, and scrolling through coding memes on Instagram.\nOnce they get an application to function, the night before the project is due, they frantically start googling in hopes they might stumble upon a stackoverflow answer to their css ineptitude. They then start copying and pasting like a mofo.\nUpon seeing the application design for the first time, everyone wonders why it looks like\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;it looks like it was designed by a person who has the aesthetic sensibilities of a cinder block wall\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;a.k.a. an engineer.\nThe designers are naturally frustrated, \u0026ldquo;What the hell is this? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look and feel like the product I designed.\u0026rdquo;\nThe engineers are frustrated, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean? It looks fine to me.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd product managers are stuck in the middle asking, \u0026ldquo;What wrong decisions did I make in life that led me down this road of endless misery?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the lesson. You likely don\u0026rsquo;t have a Spectre on your team. If you do, then count your luckily stars, say your hail marys, and perform whatever sacred ritual is required to get that person to stick around. Blackmail them if you have to. Because most likely they are already being lured in by better bait.\nSince you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have a Spectre, it means that someone in your company has to know, care, and own the relationship between designer and engineer. And as much as the company wants this person to be the full-stack developer they just hired out of a coding bootcamp, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not them.\nSomeone must fill the gap between graphic design and functional engineering. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen where that person reports to the design team and they are responsible for the technical implication of a design. I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen where this person reports to the engineering team. Regardless, as a Product Manager whose job it is to make sure that real users get value from your product, you must force your company to have this conversation and force the ownership. If your company doesn\u0026rsquo;t care and there isn\u0026rsquo;t anyone that knows how to professionally style an application, then consider learning how to do it yourself or finding a job somewhere else. Life is too short to be haunted by the hell of constantly asking, \u0026ldquo;Why does this product suck so bad?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd no, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt for you to learn more about technical design yourself\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;that is\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;if you are going to make a long career out of this\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;which\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t blame you if you don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe point is that if you are a product manager, you can\u0026rsquo;t just assume that everyone is a full-stack developer and that this design handoff problem will somehow just take care of itself. If you do, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a product that you most definitely are embarrassed to put on your resume.\nIf you are a programmer, please admit the truth and tell your leaders you have zero desire to be implementing CSS and that you suck at it. Don\u0026rsquo;t force product managers to accept your cinder-block design.\nAnd if you are a graphic designer masquerading as a UX professional, then please go out and get my new program Phetchma\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and learn how design gets applied to a real software product. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/full-stack-developer/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson 14: Full Stack Developer","type":"humor"},{"content":"Lesson 15: Data or Tada\nWho doesn\u0026rsquo;t like a good magic trick?\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re not tricks. They are illusions\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;#nameThatShow.\nEvery magic trick is essentially the same. The magician presents the audience with some ordinary thing, like an adult woman lying in a box. Then something dramatic happens such as when the woman gets sawed in half. And then there is a resolution when the lady is put back together and climbs out of the box in one piece.\nWe all stare in jaw-dropping awe and the seeming miracle we just witnessed.\nNow let me ask you this\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;are you ready to perform some jaw-dropping miracles? # Make no mistake. Your organization leaders expect you to be a magician with product data. They have experienced the drama of trying to get data themselves, and now they anxiously await for you to resolve their concerns by performing a miracle. The data you materialize — seemingly out of thin air — will create game-changing business efficiency and insights the depth of Loch Ness\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and yes, finding the Loch Ness Monster might be a more achievable goal. # Yet you know that you are no magician, nor are you a mythical creature hunter. You are just a confused bystander who stumbled upon the stage but has no idea how the magic trick is supposed to work\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;I should be in the audience,\u0026rdquo; you say to yourself as you stand there, the spotlight nearly blinding your eyes. \u0026ldquo;I guess I just wave my wand over this hat?\u0026rdquo; you think to yourself, feeling a little bit ridiculous. You then utter the words \u0026ldquo;Tada!\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;no rabbit pops out.\nYou are left standing there like a fool\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;the audience boos\u0026hellip; # \u0026hellip;it ain\u0026rsquo;t easy.\nIt would be impossible to enumerate the number of articles and quotes that claim data is the key to being a successful product manager.\nIt matters.\nSo what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for is the buzzword \u0026ldquo;data-driven\u0026rdquo;. At least once a week you will hear someone tell you that you need to be making data-driven decisions.\nI think there is even an official acronym for this concept which proves it has the complete support and forceful backing of the entire technological community.\nDDDM stands for Data-Driven Decision Making.\nOver the past decade or so, data fads have surfaced, sank, and re-surfaced like a Navy submarine. Until DDDM, it was all about data warehouses, and data lakes, and data mining and, of course, the Godzilla of all data concepts \u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;Big Data. # Big Data infested the technology community like malware on a porn addicts laptop. Every company, regardless of the bigness of their data, launched a big data initiative.\nBut after every company across the globe collectively poured billions of dollars into big data initiatives, the end result was actually just a few bar and pie graphs.\n\u0026ldquo;So what you\u0026rsquo;re telling me is that our data actually isn\u0026rsquo;t that big and that nobody cares and that big data isn\u0026rsquo;t going to make my yacht payment?\u0026rdquo; most leaders finally admitted.\nSo now Big Data isn\u0026rsquo;t quite the hype it used to be.\nNow don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, some companies really did have big data and they figured out how to use it for their own profit and world dominance. Those companies are now what are currently referred to as Big Tech. At one point in the past 5 years it was reported that 70% of internet traffic ultimately went through Google and Facebook companies.\nPretty much all information, including the manipulation of public opinion is now controlled by big data algorithms.\nSo unless you work in \u0026ldquo;Big Tech\u0026rdquo;, your company probably sucks at gathering, organizing, and manipulating people in any meaningful way. Your data is likely scattered across a bunch of poorly structured databases and you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to put it all together by begging people to run one-off queries so you can manually create your own excel spreadsheets.\n\u0026ldquo;Can you please run that one query for me?\u0026rdquo; you sheepishly ask an engineer every Monday during the daily standup. The engineer rolls their eyes to make sure it is understood how inconvenient this request is. You are then given a lecture on how all these requests are not part of their sprint tasks and how these need to be considered as part of their available capacity. The rest of the dev team nods in agreement.\n\u0026ldquo;Tada!\u0026rdquo; the engineer says after he takes 10 seconds out of his busy day to run the query. \u0026ldquo;You made me late for my ping pong match,\u0026rdquo; he scolds.\nThat engineer vows to play an extra game of ping pong today to mentally recover from all the hardships you have put him through.\nThis is the world most of us operate in\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;we are the fledgling group of small-tech small-data misfits\u0026hellip; # So what do we do about the magic trick. Remember, you are definitely expected to make data driven decision even in the face of a complete data dearth. You will never be able to win in the arena of ideas if you can\u0026rsquo;t back up your ideas and priorities with data.\nI like to imagine product ideas as a WWE match.\n\u0026ldquo;And in this corner we have a business executive with mighty industry experience, business muscle to make any decision he wants, and a mean corner office with a fridge full of Bubly Sparkling Water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And in this corner we have a product manager with the strength of a JIRA login, no data to support any of his ideas, and he works in a 3 x 3 cubicle on an IBM ThinkPad.\u0026rdquo;\nThis fight would be like Hulk Hogan vs. Pee Wee Herman.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know who these 80s references are, then it would be like Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift. I mean, seriously, what is poor Taylor going to do?\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;write a revenge song about how unfair life is. # \u0026ldquo;My castle crumbled overnight I brought a knife to a gunfight They took the crown but it\u0026rsquo;s alright\u0026rdquo;\nLittle did you know how much you have in common with Taylor Swift. Competing in the ring of product ideas without data is like bringing a knife to a gunfight\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;or giving a weakass speech at the MTV Music Awards. # So here\u0026rsquo;s the lesson. There\u0026rsquo;s no excuse for not having data, and you have to do whatever it takes to get it. It is very unlikely that it will be presented to you in a tight little package with a pretty bow. It\u0026rsquo;s going to take work. Nobody else is going to know how to get the data and you are going to have to perform a magic trick.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s try to resist the initial impulse of complaining about why the company doesn\u0026rsquo;t embark on an expensive data initiative just so you can have a few bar and pie graphs.\nLastly, let\u0026rsquo;s all calm down on the whole Big Data thing.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need BIG DATA. You just need enough to show that you know what you are talking about, you know, so you can do the whole DDDM miracle.\nBesides, Big Data doesn\u0026rsquo;t even help you with some of the core product questions you need to answer. Here are the few problems you are trying to answer:\nAm I prioritizing the right value for our customers? Am I positioning the product effectively in the market? Am I meeting the companies financial and business goals? While many PMs focus solely on usage data that is generated by the product, you need to be looking at many sources of valuable product data. Primarily this includes the hard work of talking to people and gaining insights from the real world, talking to people inside the company to understand the company\u0026rsquo;s business model and strategic plan, and talking to people to stay on top of general tech and market trends.\nIn other words, don\u0026rsquo;t just be a nerd who stares at an excel spreadsheet. You need to also gather qualitative data via conversation and real-world user feedback.\nSo go get the product data that will let you DDDM. Figure out the magic trick. Go hunt for the Loch Ness monster. Do these hard things and build your product ideas on a solid foundation of data and you will have much greater chance for success with your products.\n\u0026ldquo;Tada!\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll exclaim.\nAnd who can argue with the miracles they can\u0026rsquo;t explain?\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/humor/full-stack-developer/","section":"Humor Articles","summary":"","title":"Lesson
